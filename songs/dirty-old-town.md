I met my l[G]ove by the gas works wall
Dreamed a d[C]ream by the old ca[G]nal
I kissed my g[G]irl by the factory wall
Dirty old [D]town, dirty old [Em]town

Clouds are d[G]rifting across the moon
Cats are p[C]rowling on their [G]beat
Springs a g[G]irl from the streets at night
Dirty old [D]town, dirty old [Em]town

I heard a s[G]iren from the docks
Saw a t[C]rain set the night on [G]fire
I smelled the [G]spring on the smoky wind
Dirty old [D]town, dirty old [Em]town

I'm gonna m[G]ake me a big sharp axe
Shining [C]steel tempered in the [G]fire
I'll chop you d[G]own like an old dead tree
Dirty old [D]town, dirty old [Em]town

I met my l[G]ove by the gas works wall
Dreamed a d[C]ream by the old ca[G]nal
I kissed my g[G]irl by the factory wall
Dirty old [Am]town, dirty old [Em]town
Dirty old [D]town, dirty old [Em]town
