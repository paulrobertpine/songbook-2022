[C] Call you up in the middle of the night
[Em/B] Like a firefly without a light
[Am] You were there like a blowtorch burnin'
[G] I was a key that could use a little turnin'

[C] So tired that I couldn't even sleep
[Em/B] So many secrets I couldn't keep
[Am] Promised myself I wouldn't weep
[G] One more promise I couldn't keep

It [F]seems no one can [G]help me now
I'm [C ]in too deep, there's [Am]no way out
[F]This time I have [Em]really led [G]myself astray

[C] Runaway train never going back
[Em] Wrong way on a one-way track
[Am] Seems like I should be getting somewhere
[G] Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[C] Can you help me remember how to smile
[Em/B] Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
[Am] How on earth did I get so jaded
[G] Life's mysteries seem so faded

[C] I can go where no one else can go
[Em/B] I know what no one else knows
[Am] Here I am just drowning in the rain
[G] With a ticket for a runaway train

And [F]everything seems [G]cut and dry
[C] Day and night, [Am]earth and sky
[F] Somehow I [Em]just don't [G]believe it

[C] Runaway train never going back
[Em] Wrong way on a one-way track
[Am] Seems like I should be getting somewhere
[G] Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[C] Bought a ticket for a runaway train
[Em/B] Like a madman laughing at the rain
[Am] Little out of touch, little insane
[G] It's just easier than dealing with the pain

[C] Runaway train never going back
[Em] Wrong way on a one-way track
[Am] Seems like I should be getting somewhere
[G] Somehow I'm neither here nor there

[C] Runaway train never coming back
[Em] Runaway train tearing up the track
[Am] Runaway train burning in my veins
[G] I'd runaway but it always seems the same
