[A]Oh dear, [E7]what can I do?
[D7]Baby's in black and [E7]I'm feeling blue
Tell me, [A]oh [D]what can I [A]do?[E7]

[A]She thinks of him
And [A7]so she dresses in [D]black
And though he'll never come [A]back
[E7]She's dressed in [A]black

[A]Oh dear, [E7]what can I do?
[D7]Baby's in black and [E7]I'm feeling blue
Tell me, [A]oh [D]what can I [A]do?[E7]

[A]I think of her
But [A7]she thinks only of [D]him
And though it's only a [A]whim
[E7]She thinks of [A]him


[F#m]Oh how [B7]long it will take
[D]'Til she [E7]sees the mistake she has 
[A]made? dear, [E7]what can I do?
[D7]Baby's in black and [E7]I'm feeling blue
Tell me, [A]oh [E7]what can I [A]do?

Tell me, [A]oh [E7]what can I [A]do?

[A]She thinks of him
And [A7]so she dresses in [D]black
And though he'll never come [A]back
[E7]She's dressed in [A]black

[A]Oh dear, [E7]what can I do?
[D7]Baby's in black and [E7]I'm feeling blue
Tell me, [A]oh [D]what can I [A]do?[E7]
