It's a [C]long and dusty road
It's a [F]hot and [Em]heavy [Dm]load
And the [G7]folks I meet ain't always [C]kind
Some are [C]bad and some are good
Some have [F]done the [Em]best they [Dm]could
[G7]Some have tried to ease my trouble in [C]mind

And I [Dm]can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound, where I'm [Am]bound
[Dm]Can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound

I've been [C]wandering through this land
Just [F]doin' the [Em]best I [Dm]can
[G7]Trying to find what I was meant to [C]do

And the people that I see
Look as [F]worried [Em]as can [Dm]be
And it [G7]looks like they are wanderin' [C]too

And I [Dm]can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound, where I'm [Am]bound
[Dm]Can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound

(Instrumental)

But I [C]had a little girl one time
She had [F]lips like [Em]cherry [Dm]wine
And she [G7]loved me, till my head went plum in[C]sane

But I was, too blind to see
She was [F]driftin' a[Em]way from [Dm]me
And my [G7]good girl went off on a midnight [C]train

And I [Dm]can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound, where I'm [Am]bound
[Dm]Can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound

(Instrumental)

If you [C]see me passin' by
And you [F]sit and you [Em]wonder [Dm]why
And you [G7]wish that you were rambling [C]too

nail your shoes to the kitchen floor
Lace'em [F]up and [Em]bar the [Dm]door
[G7]Thank your stars for the roof that's over [C]you

And I [Dm]can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound, where I'm [Am]bound
[Dm]Can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound

I [Dm]can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound, where I'm [Am]bound
[Dm]Can't help but [G]wonder where I'm [C]bound
