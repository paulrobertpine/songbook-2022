title: Mamas Don't Let Your Babies Grow Up to be Cowboys
artist: Willie Nelson
key: D

[D]Cowboys ain't easy to love and they're harder to [G]hold
[A]They'd rather give you a song than diamonds or [D]gold
[D]Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levi's and [G]each night begins a new day
If you do[A]n't understand him and he don't die young
He'll probably just ride a[D]way

[D]Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be [G]cowboys
Don't [A]let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and [D]such
[D]Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be [G]cowboys
They'll [A]never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they [D]love

[E]Cowboys like smokey ol' pool rooms and clear mountain [A]mornings
[B]Little warm puppies, and children, and girls of the n[E]ight
[E]Them that don't know him won't like him and them that do [A]sometimes won't know how to take him
He ain't [B]wrong, he's just different but his pride won't let him
Do the things to make you think he's [E]right

[E]Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be [A]cowboys
Don't [B]let 'em pick guitars and drive them old trucks
Let 'em be doctors and lawyers and [E]such
[E]Mammas don't let your babies grow up to be [A]cowboys
They'll [B]never stay home and they're always alone
Even with someone they [E]love
