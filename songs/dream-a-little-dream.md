[C]   Stars [B7]shining bright [Ab]above [G]you
[C]   Night [B7]breezes seem to [A]whisper I [A7]love you
[Dm]    Birds singing in the [Fm]sycamore tree
[C]Dream a little [D9]dream of [G7]me

[C]    Say [B7]nighty- night and [Ab]kiss [G]me
[C]    Just [B7]hold me tight and [A]tell me you’ll [A7]miss me
[Dm]    While I’m alone as [Fm]blue as can be
[C]Dream a little [Fm]dream [G7]of  [C]me[Eb7]

[Ab]    Stars [Fm]fading but [Eb7]I linger on dear
[Ab]  Still [Fm]craving your [Eb7]kiss
[Ab]   I’m [Fm]longing to [Eb7]linger til dawn dear
[Ab]   Just [Fm]saying [G7]this

[C]   Sweet [B7]dreams til sunbeams [Ab7]find  [G7]you
[C]   Sweet [B7]dreams that leave all [A]worries be[A7]hind you
[Dm]    And in your dreams what[Fm]ever they be
[C]Dream a little [Fm]dream [G7]of   [C]me
