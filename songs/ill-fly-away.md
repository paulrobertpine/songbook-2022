G                   G7                     C        G
Some bright morning when this life is o'er, I'll fly away
G                                        D7   G
To a home on God's celestial shore, I'll fly away

G                 G7    C        G
I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away (in the mornin)
G    C  G                              D7   G
When I die, hallelujah, by and by I'll fly away

G                 G7                       C        G
When the shadows of this life have grown, I'll fly away
G                                             D7   G
Like a bird from prison walls has flown, I'll fly away

G                G7     C        G
I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away
G                                 D7   G
When I die, hallelujah, by and by I'll fly away

G                G7                    C        G
Just a few more weary days, and then, I'll fly away
G                                           D7   G
To a land where joys shall never end, I'll fly away

G                 G7     C        G
I'll fly away, O glory, I'll fly away
G    C  G                              D7   G
When I die, hallelujah, by and by I'll fly away
