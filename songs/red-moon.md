[D]Red moon rising like a [C]fire in me[G]
So many [D]questions, she asks them [C]all to  me[G]
I have to[D] answer most [C]curiously[G]
Scarlet [D]angel, I am too [C]small to see[G]
[D]Earn earn, shuffle round the [C]big city[G]
Burning the [D]rubber down, crossing the [C]hot concrete[G]
I'm gonna [D]leave town, there is [C]someone to meet[G]
She turns her [D]head around a full [C]three-sixty[G]

Woo!

[D]Bedroom rising from an [C]old growth [G]tree
Bring out the [D]sawmill, cutting the [C]twelve-inch beams[G]
Building a [D]pattern, a reservoir to [C]fill with dreams[G]
Rings like [D]Saturn telling their [C]old stories[G]
[D]Windmill turn and turn e[C]ternally[G]
What do you [D]yearn for? Where do you [C]long to be?[G]
I've been [D]here before, looking at the [C]wild country[G]
Opening the [D]screen door, talking with [C]Diane Lee[G]

That's my grandma!

[D]Radio singing from the [C]corner of the [G]kitchen
I got the [D]oven on, I got the [C]onions [G]wishing
They hadn't [D]made me cry, filling the [C]sink with [G]dishes
Letting them [D]air dry, waiting for the [C]wind's per[G]mission
[D]Too many movies got me [C]shivering and [G]shy
Turning the [D]lights out, glistening in the [C]owl's eye[G]
Glimmer like [D]lightning under the [C]violet sky[G]
Shimmer like [D]diamonds, watching the [C]red moon ri[G]se

Ooo
