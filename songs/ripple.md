[G] [C][G][C][G][D][C][G]

[G]If my words did glow, with the gold of [C]sunshine
And my tunes, were played, on the harp un[G]strung
Would you hear my voice, come through the [C]music?
Would you [G]hold it [D]near, [C]as it were your [G]own?

[G]It's a hand-me-down, the thoughts are [C]broken
Perhaps they're better left un[G]sung
I don't know, don't really [C]care
[G]Let there be [D]songs, [C]to fill the [G]air

[Am]Ripple in still [D]water,
When there [G]is no pebble [C]tossed,
Nor [A]wind to [D]blow

Reach out your [G]hand, if your cup be [C]empty
If your cup is full, may it be a[G]gain
Let it be known, there is a [C]fountain
[G]That was not [D]made, [C]by the hands of [G]men

[G]There is a road, no simple [C]highway
Between the dawn, and the dark of [G]night
And if you go, no one may [C]follow
[G]That path is [D]for, [C]your steps [G]alone

[Am]Ripple in still [D]water,
When there [G]is no pebble [C]tossed,
Nor [A]wind to [D]blow

You who [G]choose, to lead must [C]follow
But if you fall, you fall a[G]lone
If you should stand, then who's to [C]guide you?
[G]If I knew the [D]way, [C]I would take you [G]home

[G]Da Da Da [C]Da[G] 2[C]x[G][D][C][G]
