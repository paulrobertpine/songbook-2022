[E]Let it rain,[A7]let it pour,
[E]Let it rain a [A7]whole lot more,
'Cause [E]I got them deep river [B7]blues.
[E]Let the rain [A7]drive right on,
[E]Let the waves [A7]sweep along,
'Cause [E]I got them [B7]deep river [E]blues.

My old gal's a good old pal,
She walks like a water fowl,
When I get them deep river blues.
Ain't no one to cry for me,
And the fish all go out on a spree
When I get them deep river blues.

Give me back my old boat,
I'm gonna sail if she'll float,
'Cause I got them deep river blues,
I'm goin' back to Muscle Shoals,
Times are better there I'm told,
Cause I got them deep river blues.

If my boat sinks with me.
I'll go down, don't you see,
'Cause I got them deep river blues,
Now I'm gonna say goodbye,
And if I sink, just let me die,
'Cause I got them deep river blues.
