 [G]Strange and [D]beautiful are the [Em]stars [D]tonight
 [G]That [D]dance around your [Em]head
 [G]In your [D]eyes I see that [Em]perfect [D]world
 [G]I hope that [D]doesn't sound too [Em]weird[C]

 [C]And I want all the [D]world to [D]know[G][/][/][/][C][(ring)]
 That [D]your love's all I [Em]need
 [Em]all that I [D]need
 and if we[G]'re [D]lo[/]st[/], [Em]   [/]  [/]then [C]we are lost [D]together
 yea if we[G]'re [D]lo[/]st[/], [Em]   [/]  [/]then [C]we are lost [D]together

 [G]I stand [D]before this [Em]faceless [D]crowd and [G]wonder [D]why i [Em]bother
 [G]so much [D]controlled [Em]by so [D]few, stumbling [G]from one [D]disaster to [Em]another
 [C]I've heard it all so many [D]times [D]before[G][/][/][/][C]
 [C]it's all a [D]dream to me [Em]now, a [Em]dream to me [D]now
 and if we[G]'re [D]lo[/]st[/], [Em]   [/]  t[/]hen [C]we are lost [D]together
 yea if we[G]'re [D]lo[/]st[/], [Em]   [/]  t[/]hen [C]we are lost [D]together

[C]  [D]  [G] [C] [D] [Em]  [D] [Cadd9] [G/B] [D/A] [G]

 [G]In the [D]silence of this [Em]whispered [D]night I [G]listen [D]only to your [Em]breath
 [G]and in that [D]second of a [Em]shooting [D]star [G]somehow it [D]all makes [Em]sense
 [C]And I want all the [D]world to [D]know[G][/][/][/][C][(ring)]
 That [D]your love's all I [Em]need
 [Em]all that I [D]need[/][/][/]
 and if we[G]'re [D]lo[/]st[/], [Em]     then [C]we are lost [D]together
 yea if we[G]'re [D]lo[/]st[/], [Em]     then [C]we are lost [D]together
