Well, the [C]drunken clown's still [Em]hanging 'round
but it's [F]plain the [Em]laughter's [Dm]all died down
The [G]tears you tried so [F]hard to hide are [C]flowing
And a [C]blind man with his [Em]knife in hand
has con[F]vinced hi[Em]mself that he [Dm]understands
I [G]wish him well, Miss Carousel,
but [F]I gotta be a-[C]going

[Am]  Won't you come and [Em]get me when
You're [Am]sure that you don't n[Em]eed me then
I'll [Am]stand outside your [Em]window
and [F]proudly call your [Em]name[G][G7]

Well, the [C]lady's been told that [Em]all the gold
is [F]worth so [Em]much it [Dm]can't be sold
No [G]time to weep, she'll [F]need her sleep to[C]morrow
When she [C]carries her face to the [Em]market place
and [F]bets it [Em]on the [Dm]opening race
She can [G]ring her bells, Miss Carousel,
but her [F]singing brings me [C]sorrow

[Am]  Won't you come and [Em]get me when
You're [Am]sure that you don't n[Em]eed me then
I'll [Am]stand outside your [Em]window
and [F]proudly call your [Em]name[G][G7]

Well, it's [C]always done, every [Em]mothers son
is [F]shown that [Em]grown men [Dm]never run
And [G]so they fight with [F]all the might in[C]side them
When the [C]battle's been fought 'n they've [Em]all been taught
that the [F]trick is [Em]just not [Dm]being caught
Will you [G]give 'em hell, Miss Carousel,
when they're [F]begging you to [C]hide them

[Am]  Won't you come and [Em]get me when
You're [Am]sure that you don't n[Em]eed me then
I'll st[Am]and outside your w[Em]indow
and pro[F]udly call your [Em]name[G][G7]

When the [C]need arose, your [Em]eyes fell closed
You [F]clamped your [Em]fingers 'r[Dm]ound your nose
[G]Would you say, that's [F]any way to [C]judge him
Well, you [C]haven't got the [Em]authority
to [F]kill him [Em]in the [Dm]first degree
But would you [G]feel compelled, Miss Carousel,
if you [F]had something to be[C]grudge him

| Am  | Em  | Am  | Em  | Am  | Em  | F   |
| Em  | Em  | G   | G7  |

On a [C]velvet beach far be[Em]neath the reach
of [F]those who [Em]come to [Dm]pry and preach
The [G]natural man that [F]tried to stand is [C]falling
Well, how [C]long will it be be[Em]fore he sees
you [F]own his [Em]legs but his [Dm]mind is free
Only [G]you can tell, Miss Carousel,
how [F]long will he be [C]crawling

[Am]  Won't you come and [Em]get me when
You're [Am]sure that you don't [Em]need me then
I'll [Am]stand outside your [Em]window
and [F]proudly call your [Em]name[G][G7]

Ah, the [C]castle wall has [Em]grown so tall
[F]Seems there [Em]ain't no [Dm]hope at all
to [G]reach the top even [F]though you stopped for [C]breathing
But I [C]ain't gonna try to [Em]make you cry,
the [F]teardrops [Em]couldn't [Dm]find your eyes
It's [G]all been swell, Miss Carousel,
but the [F]time has come for [C]leaving

[Am]  Won't you come and [Em]get me when
You're [Am]sure that you don't n[Em]eed me then
I'll [Am]stand outside your w[Em]indow
and [F]proudly call your [Em]name[G][G7]

[Am]  Won't you come and [Em]get me when
You're [Am]sure that you don't n[Em]eed me then
I'll [Am]stand outside your [Em]window
and [F]proudly call your [Em]name[G][G7]

[Am]  Won't you come and [Em]get me when
You're [Am]sure that you don't n[Em]eed me then
I'll [Am]stand outside your [Em]window
and [F]proudly call your [Em]name[G][G7]

[Am]  Won't you come and [Em]get me when
You're [Am]sure that you don't n[Em]eed me then
I'll [Am]stand outside your [Em]window
and [F]proudly call your [Em]name[G][G7]
