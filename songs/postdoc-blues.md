[Em][G][C]
[Em][G][C]

[Em]So your [G]presentation went [C]terrible
[Em]All wrong [G]dongle, sweat stains and[C]stares
[Em]Leave the [G]TV on with the [C]sound down low
[Em]    [G]  In your under[C]wear

[A]Don't despair, you'll get[C]it right
To[G]morrow night in [D]Thunder Bay maybe
[A]Don't delay, your [C]day is short
You [G]can't afford to [D]wait

[Em]I bel[G]ieve in you and your [C]PowerPoints
[Em]I know [G]why you can't stay a[C]wake
[Em]Out on [G]Highway One with a [C]rental car
[Em]    [G]  And a lot to say[C]

[A]Don't despair, you'll get[C]it right
To[G]morrow night in [D]Nipigon, maybe
[A]Don't delay, our [C]day is short
We [G]can't afford to [D]wait

[Em] [G][C]

[D]  So take that la[Am]minate out of your [C]wallet and [G]read it
[D]  And reco[Am]mmit yourself to the [C]healing of the [G]world
[D]  And to the [Am]welfare of all [C]creatures u[G]pon it
[D]  Pursue a [Am]practice that will [C]strengthen your [Em]heart[G][C]

[Em][G][C]
[Em]
