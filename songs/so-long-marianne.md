Come [A]over to the window, my little d[Bm]arling
[D]I'd like to try to read your pa[A]lm
[G]I used to think I was some kind of gy[D]psy boy
[F#m] before I let you take me [E]home[Esus4][e][E7]

Now [A]so long, Marianne,[F#m]It's time that we began
to l[E]augh[Esus4] and [E]cry[E7] and [E]cr[Esus4]y and l[E]augh ab[E7]out it [A]all again[Asus4]

Well you k[A]now that I love to [Bm]live with you
[D] but you make me forget so very m[A]uch
[G] I forget to pray for the a[D]ngels
and then the [F#m]angels forget to pray for [Esus4]us[E][e7]

Now [A]so long, Marianne,[F#m]It's time that we began
to l[E]augh[Esus4] and [E]cry[E7] and [E]cr[Esus4]y and l[E]augh ab[E7]out it [A]all again[Asus4]

We m[A]et when we were [Bm]almost young
[D] deep in the green Lilac p[A]ark
[G] You held on to me like I was a c[D]rucifix
[F#m] as we went kneeling through the d[E]ark[Esus4][e][E7]

Oh [A]so long, Marianne,[F#m]It's time that we began
to l[E]augh[Esus4] and [E]cry[E7] and [E]cr[Esus4]y and l[E]augh ab[E7]out it [A]all again[Asus4]

Your l[A]etters they all say that you're be[Bm]side me now
[D] then why do I feel al[A]one
[G] I'm standing on a ledge and your [D]fine spider web
is f[F#m]astening my ankle to a st[E]one[Esus4][e][E7]

Now [A]so long, Marianne,[F#m]It's time that we began
to l[E]augh[Esus4] and [E]cry[E7] and [E]cr[Esus4]y and l[E]augh ab[E7]out it [A]all again[Asus4]

For n[A]ow I need your [Bm]hidden love
[D] I'm cold as a new razor b[A]lade
[G] You left when I told you I was c[D]urious
[F#m] I never said that I was b[E]rave[Esus4][e][E7]

Oh [A]so long, Marianne,[F#m]It's time that we began
to l[E]augh[Esus4] and [E]cry[E7] and [E]cr[Esus4]y and l[E]augh ab[E7]out it [A]all again[Asus4]

Oh, y[A]ou are really such a p[Bm]retty one
[D] I see you've gone and changed your [A]name again
[G] And just when I climbed this w[D]hole mountainside
to w[F#m]ash my eye\_\_lids in the ra[E]in[Esus4][e][E7]

Oh [A]so long, Marianne,[F#m]It's time that we began
to l[E]augh[Esus4] and [E]cry[E7] and [E]cr[Esus4]y and l[E]augh ab[E7]out it [A]all again[Asus4]
