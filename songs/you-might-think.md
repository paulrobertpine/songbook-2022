[D] [G][A][D][D][G][A][Bm][G][A][D][D]

Ah well, [D]you might think I'm [G]crazy
To [A]hang around with [D]you
[D]Maybe you think I'm [G]lucky
To [A]have something to [D]do

but I [Bm]think [A]that you're [G]wild
And in[Bm]side me [A]is some [G]child

[D]You might think I'm [G]foolish
Or [A]maybe it's un[Bm]true [Bm/C#](you might think)
[D]You might think I'm [G]crazy (all I want)
But [A]all I want is [D]you[G][A]

[D]You might think it's hys[G]terical
But [A]I know when you're [D]weak
You [D]think you're in the [G]movies
And [A]everything's so [D]deep

But I [Bm]think [A]that you're [G]wild
When you [Bm]flash that [A]fragile [G]smile

[D]You might think it's [G]foolish
[A]What you put me th[Bm]rough [Bm/C#](you might think)
[D]You might think I'm [G]crazy (all I want)
But [D]all I want is [D]you[D]

And it was [Bm]hard,[G] so [A]hard to [Bm]take
[G] There's [A]no es[Bm]cape,
[G] With[A]out a [Bm]scrap[G]e[A][G]
[G]   [N.C.]But you kept it going till the sun fell down
[A]   [N.C.]You kept it..... going

[D] [G][A][D][D][G][A][Bm][G][A][D]

Ah well, [D]you might think I'm de[G]lirious
The [A]way I run you [D]down
But [D]somewhere, sometime, [G]when you're curious
[A]I'll be back a[D]round

And I [Bm]think [A]that you're [G]wild
And [Bm]so un[A]iquely [G]styled

[D]You might think it's f[G]oolish
This [A]chancey rendez[Bm]vous [Bm/C#](you might think)
[D]You might think I'm [G]crazy (all I want)
But [A]all I want is [D]you
[G]All I [A]want is [Bm]you
all I [G]want [A]is [D]you
