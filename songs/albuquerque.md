Well they [Em]say that Santa [D]Fe
is less than ninety miles [D]away
and I've got [Em]time to roll a [G]number and rent a [A]car

Oh [G]Aaa-[Em]albu-[D]querque

I've been [Em]flying down the [D]road
and I've been [Em]starving to be [D]alone
Inde-[Em]pendent from the [G]scene that I've [A]known

Oh [G]Aaa-[Em]albu-[D]querque

(solos on verse)

So I'll [Em]stop when I [D]can
Find some [Em]fried eggs and country [D]ham
I'll find [Em]somewhere where they [G]don't care who I [A]am

Oh [G]Aaa-[Em]albu-[D]querque (x2)
