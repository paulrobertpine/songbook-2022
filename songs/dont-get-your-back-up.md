B                                            E
Baby, if I could keep it together, don't you think I'd try?
    B                                       E
And maybe if I could make something of this, why wouldn't I?
          B
You say I close a blind eye that I don't put up the time
             E
But what you see as goodbye, I don't see as a crime
    B
I'm tired of the blame being put on my head
       E                                                 B  E  B  E
You're breathing fire but you're not bringing back what's dead
 
B    F#        E
Don't get your back up over this
B           F#                  E
  If I'm so wrong and you're so right
B  F#                  E
You, well you got your mind made up I guess
F#                                         B  E
  Won't you let me get some sleep tonight?
 
      B                                         E
It's late now and there's only four hours 'til I get up again
             B                                                   E
You know I'd wait somehow if I thought this was something that a little time would mend
B                         E
You, you're dragging this misery on
      B                                  E                    B  E
Let's leave this thing for a while, it's too far gone, too far gone
 
 
B    F#        E
Don't get your back up over this
B           F#                  E
  If I'm so wrong and you're so right
     B  F#               E
Well you really got your mind made up I guess
F#
  Won't you let me get some sleep
F#
  Won't you let me get some sleep?
F#                                         B
  Won't you let me get some sleep tonight?
 
 
B    F#        E
Don't get your back up over this
B           F#                  E
  If I'm so wrong and you're so right
B  F#                  E
You, well you got your mind made up I guess
F#
  Won't you let me get some sleep
F#
  Won't you let me get some sleep?
F#
  Won't you let me get some sleep tonight?
B   E
  Tonight
