[G]Sittin' on the front porch on a[C]sunny afternoon
on a [G]straight back chair on two legs[D] leaned against th[G]e wall
Watch the kids all playin' with [C]june bugs on a string
[G]Chase the glowin' firefly as the[D] evening shadow[G]s fall

In my Tennesee [C]mountain home[G] life is as peaceful as [D]a baby[G]'s sigh.
In my Tennesee [C]mountain home[G] drinkin' singin' i[D]t feels d[G]iv-ine.

[G]Honey-suckel vine grows on the[C]fence along the way
It's [G]summer fragrance[D] makes the wind s[G]o sweet
And on a distant hill top an [C]eagle spreads it's wings
a [G]song bird on the fence post[D] sings a mel[G]o-dy.

In my Tennesee [C]mountain home[G] life is as peaceful as [D]a baby[G]'s sigh.
In my Tennesee [C]mountain home[G] drinkin' singin' i[D]t feels d[G]iv-ine.

[G]Walkin' home from school on sunday[C]with the one you love
[G]Laughin', talkin',[D] makin' futur[G]e plans
When the folks 'aint lookin' you might [C]steal a kiss or two
[G]Sittin' on the[D] porch swing holdin[G]' hands.

In my Tennesee [C]mountain home[G] life is as peaceful as [D]a baby[G]'s sigh.
In my Tennesee [C]mountain home[G] drinkin' singin' i[D]t feels d[G]iv-ine.
