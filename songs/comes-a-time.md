[G] [G][G][G]

[G]Comes a time,[Bm]when you’re driftin’
[D]  Comes a time, when you [Am7]settle down[C]
[G]  Comes a light,[Bm]feelings liftin’
[D]  Lift that baby right up [Am7]off the ground[C]

[G]Oh, [F]this old w[C]orld keeps [G]spinnin’ ‘round
It’s a [F]wonder tall [C]trees ain’t [G]laying down
There comes a t[Dm7]ime[G]

[G]You and I,[Bm]we were captured
[D]  We took our souls, and we [Am7]flew away[C]
[G]  We were right,[Bm]we were giving
[D]  That’s how we kept what we [Am7]gave away[C]

[G]Oh, [F]this old w[C]orld keeps [G]spinnin’ ‘round
It’s a [F]wonder tall [C]trees ain’t [G]laying down
There comes a t[Dm7]ime[G]

[G]    [Bm]    [D]    [Am7]  [C]
[G]    [Bm]    [D]    [Am7]  [C]

[G]Oh, [F]this old w[C]orld keeps [G]spinnin’ ‘round
It’s a [F]wonder tall [C]trees ain’t [G]laying down
There comes a t[Dm7]ime[G]

(G)            [Dm7]    [G]
There comes a time
Comes a t[Dm7]ime, comes a [G]time
Comes a t[Dm7]ime[G]
Comes a t[Dm7]ime[G]
Comes a t[Dm7]ime[G]
Comes a t[Dm7]ime[G]
Comes a t[Dm7]ime
