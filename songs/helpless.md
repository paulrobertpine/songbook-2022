[D] [A][G][D][A][G]

[D]There is a [A]town in north Ont[G]ario,
[D]With dream[A] comfort memory to sp[G]are,
[D]and in my m[A]ind I s[G]till need a place to go,
[D]All[A] my changes were t[G]here,

[D]Blue, blue [A]windows behind th[G]e stars,
[D]Yellow moo[A]n on the rise,[G]
[D]Big birds f[A]lying a[G]cross the sky,
[D]Thr[A]owing shadows on o[G]ur eyes.

[D]Helpless, [A]helpless, help[G]less
[D]Ba[A]by can you hear me [G]now?
[D]The chain[A]s are locked and t[G]ied across the door,
[D]Ba[A]by, sing[G]with me some how.

[D] [A][G][D][A][G]

[D]Blue, blue [A]windows behind th[G]e stars,
[D]Yellow moo[A]n on the rise,[G]
[D]Big birds f[A]lying a[G]cross the sky,
[D]Thr[A]owing shadows on o[G]ur eyes.

[D]Helpless, [A]helpless, help[G]less
