[E]I hear the train a-coming, it's rolling round the bend
and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know[E7]when
I'm [A]stuck at Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin'[E]on
But that [B7]train keeps a-rollin' on down to San-[E]Antone

[E]When I was just a baby, my Mama told me 'Son,
always be a good boy; don't ever play with [E7]guns.'
But I [A]shot a man in Reno, just to watch him di[E]e
when I [B7]hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and [E]cry

(solo)

[E]I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dining car
They're probably drinking coffee and smokin[E7]g big cigars
But I [A]know I had it coming, I know I can't be [E]free
But tho[B7]se people keep a moving, and that's what [E]tortures me

(solo)

[E]Well, if they freed me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine
I bet I'd move it on a little farther down [E7]the line
Far fr[A]om Folsom Prison, that's where I want to[E]stay
And I'd[B7] let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away[E]
