[Verse]
G                        D                Em
 There's nothing you can do that can't be done
G                D                  Em
 Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Am               G                     D
 Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game,
      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 +
      D       D7      D6      D
 It's easy
 
G                        D                  Em
 There's nothing you can make that can't be made
G             D               Em
 No one you can save that can't be saved.
Am               G               D
 Nothing you can do but you can learn how to be you in time,
      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 +
      D       D7      D6      D
 It's easy
 
 
[Chorus]
G        A        D     D7
All you need is love
G        A        D     D7
All you need is love
G        B7      Em   G    C       D       G
All you need is love love, Love is all you need.

G                        D               Em
 There's nothing you can know that isn't known.
G                D              Em
 Nothing you can see that isn't shown.
Am               G              D
 Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be,
      1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 +
      D       D7      D6      D
 It's easy
 
G        A        D     D7
All you need is love,

All you need is love,
G        B7      Em   G    C       D       G
All you need is love love, Love is all you need.
