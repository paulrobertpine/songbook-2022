[Verse 1]
D           A                Bm
  See the stone set in your eyes
          G                  D
See the thorn twist in your side
   A        Bm   G
I wait for you
D             A                Bm
  Sleight of hand and twist of fate
              G                 D
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
       A        Bm       G
And I wait, without you
 
[Chorus]
            D            A
With or without you
            Bm           G
With or without you
 
[Verse 2]
D               A                 Bm
  Through the storm we reach the shore
            G               D
You give it all but I want more
         A      Bm        G
And I’m waiting for you
 
[Chorus]
            D         A
With or without you
           Bm          G
With or without you ahah
         D     A
I can’t live 
            Bm       G
With or without you
 
[Instrumental]
D A Bm G
 
[Bridge]
         D             A
And you give yourself away
         Bm            G
And you give yourself away
         D
And you give
         A
And you give
         Bm            G
And you give yourself away
 
[Verse 3]
D               A
  My hands are tied
Bm         G                  D
 My body bruised, she got me with
            A
Nothing to win and
Bm               G
Nothing left to lose
 
[Bridge]
         D             A
And you give yourself away
         Bm            G
And you give yourself away
         D
And you give
         A
And you give
         Bm            G
And you give yourself away
 
[Chorus]
            D         A
With or without you
         Bm             G
With or without you oh-oh
         D     A
I can’t live 
            Bm       G
With or without you
 
[Interlude]
D        A
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Bm       G
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
D        A
Oh-oh-oh-oh
    Bm      G
Oh-oh-oh
 
[Chorus]
            D         A
With or without you
           Bm          G
With or without you ahah
         D     A
I can’t live 
            Bm       G
With or without you
            D
With or without you
