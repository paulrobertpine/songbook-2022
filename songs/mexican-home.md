Intro:
[C] [F] [C] [F] [C] [G] [C]

It got so hot, last [F]night, I swear
[C]You couldnt hardly [F]breathe
Heat [C]lightning burnt the [G]sky like [C]alcohol
I [C]sat on the porch [F]without my shoes
And I [C]watched the cars roll [F]by
As the [C]headlights raced
To the [G]corner of the kitchen [C]wall.

[F]        [C]
Mama dear Your boy is here
[G]Far across the [C]sea
[F]Waiting for That [C]sacred core
That burns inside of [G]me
And I [C]feel a storm
All [F]wet and warm
Not [C]ten miles [F]away
[C]Approaching My[G] mexican [C]home.

(Repeat Intro)

My [C]god! I cried, its [F]so hot inside
You could [C]die in the living [F]room
Take the [C]fan from the window
[G]Prop the door back with a [C]broom
The [C]cuckoo clock has [F]died of shock
And the [C]windows feel no [F]pane
The [C]airs as still As the [G]throttle on a funeral [C]train.

(Chorus)

(Reapeat Intro)

My [C]father died on the [F]porch outside
On an [C]august after[F]noon
I sipped [C]bourbon and cried
With a [G]friend by the light of the [C]moon
So its [C]hurry! hurry! [F]step right up
Its a [C]matter of life or [F]death
The [C]sun is going down
And the [G]moon is just holding its [C]breath.
