       C              G                 Am     Am/G Fmaj7    F6
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
C                 G              F  C/E Dm7 C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
    C              G                 Am     Am/G     Fmaj7    F6
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
C                 G              F  C/E Dm7 C
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be

       Am         G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

    C               G               Am      Am/G  Fmaj7   F6
And when the broken hearted people, living in the world agree
C                 G              F  C/E Dm7 C
There will be an answer, let it be
     C                    G             Am        Am/G        Fmaj7    F6
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
C                 G              F  C/E Dm7 C
There will be an answer, let it be

        Am        G          F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
C                G              F  C/E Dm7 C
There will be an answer, let it be
       Am         G        F          C
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be

Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

And when the night is cloudy,
