How deep in the [A]valley must you [E]go
To find what your footsteps already [B]know
The way on is the [E]way out
[A]There are signs to [E]follow
There is deep in the [B]valley
And [A]I'm bound to [E]go

How deep in the [A]valley must you [E]stay
To know why your footsteps led you that [B]way
The way on may be [E]truly to [A]stand in one [E]place

And let the deep of the valley
Fi[A]ll you will [E]grace

And treat yourself [A]lightly
Treat yourself [E]kind

You've got nothing to worry on
You will [B]be fine
You will leave this place [E]laughing
And [A]somebody will [E]cry
There is deep in the [B]valley
Wonder [A]not wh[E]y

Wonder not [A]why go
Wonder not to [E]stay

If it takes me and I follow
Or if I lead the [B]way
It can come when it [E]wants [A]to
But it might have to [E]wait

There is deep in the valley
I [A]don't hesi[E]tate

interlude
[A] [E][B][E][A][E][B][A][E]

I don't take it too [A]lightly
But it don't weigh down too [E]low

There is high on the cliff top
And there are deep creeks [B]below

There's a green shade you [E]can't mis[A]s
Where the spring water [E]flows

There is deep in the valley
And [A]I'm bound to [E]go

How deep in the [A]valley must you [E]go
To find what your footsteps already [B]know
The way on is the [E]way [A]out
There are signs to [E]follow

There is deep in the valley
And I'm [A]bound to [E]go
