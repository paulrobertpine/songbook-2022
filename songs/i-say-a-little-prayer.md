intro
[F#m](say a[D] lit[D]tle [E]pr[A]ayer[D] for[C#7]you)

verse
[F#m]    The moment I wa[Bm]ke up
Before I put [E]on my [A]makeup
I s[D]ay a little (prayer for [C#7]you)
[F#m]    And while combing my [Bm]hair, now,
And wondering what d[E]ress to w[A]ear, now,
I s[D]ay a little prayer for [C#7]you

chorus
For[D]ever and [E]ever, you'll [C#m]stay in my h[F#m]eart
and I will l[E]ove you
For[D]ever, for[E]ever, we [C#m]never will p[F#m]art
            (E)    D  D/A
Oh, how I'll love you
To[D]gether, to[E]gether, that's [C#m]how it must [F#m]be
            (E)     Bm A
To live without you
Would [D]on[D]ly [D]be [D/E]heart[D/E]break [D]for [C#7]me.[riff:][C#][C#][B][A][G#][F#][F][D]

verse
[F#m]    I run for the b[Bm]us, dear,
While riding I t[E]hink of [A]us, dear,
I [D]say a little prayer for [C#7]you.
[F#m]    And at work I just [D]take time
And all through my [E]coffee b[A]reak-time, (break-time!)
I [D]say a little prayer for [C#7]you.

chorus
For[D]ever and [E]ever, you'll [C#m]stay in my h[F#m]eart
and I will l[E]ove you
For[D]ever, for[E]ever, we [C#m]never will p[F#m]art
Oh, how I'll[E]love you
To[D]gether, to[E]gether, that's [C#m]how it must [F#m]be
To live with[E]out you
Would [D]on[D]ly [D]be [D/E]heart[D/E]break [D]for [C#7]me.    (Nobody but me)

For[D]ever and [E]ever, you'll [C#m]stay in my h[F#m]eart
and I will l[E]ove you
For[D]ever, for[E]ever, we [C#m]never will p[F#m]art
Oh, how I'll[E]love you
To[D]gether, to[E]gether, that's [C#m]how it must [F#m]be
To live with[E]out you
Would [D]on[D]ly [D]be [D/E]heart[D/E]break [D]for [C#7]me.    (Ooooh-oo-oo-oooh)

bridge
[F#m]My darling, beli[Bm]eve me,
For me the[E]re is no onnnnne
But [A]you.  Please love, be true. I'm in love with you.
[A](Answer my prayer) Answer my prayer, baby (answer my prayer)
[A]Say you love me too (this is my prayer) Answer my prayer, baby (answer my prayer)
