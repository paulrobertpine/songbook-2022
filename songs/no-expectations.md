[A]

[A]Come and t[D]ake me to the a[A]irport
Come and b[D]oard me on that pl[A]ane
Because I've g[D]ot no expect[A]ations
To ever p[G]ass this w[D]ay ag[A]ain

[A]Well o[D]nce I was a r[A]ich man
But n[D]ow I am so p[A]oor
N[D]ever in my w[A]eary life
Have I fe[G]lt like th[D]is bef[A]ore

[A]Your l[D]ove is like a d[A]iamond
And you c[D]ast your pearls to sw[A]ine
And [D]as I see you l[A]eaving me
It dr[G]ags my pe[D]ace of m[A]ind

[A]Come and t[D]ake me to the a[A]irport
Come and b[D]oard me on that pl[A]ane
Because I've g[D]ot no expect[A]ations
To ever p[G]ass this w[D]ay ag[A]ain

solo over verse

[A]Your l[D]ove is like the w[A]ater
See it sp[D]arkling on the st[A]one
Your l[D]ove is like the m[A]usic
First it's h[G]ere and th[D]en it's g[A]one

[A]Come and t[D]ake me to the a[A]irport
Come and b[D]oard me on that pl[A]ane
Because I've g[D]ot no expect[A]ations
To ever p[G]ass this w[D]ay ag[A]ain

[A]Come and t[D]ake me to the a[A]irport
Come and b[D]oard me on that pl[A]ane
Because I've g[D]ot no expect[A]ations
To ever p[G]ass this w[D]ay ag[A]ain
