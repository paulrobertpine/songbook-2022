            G
I've been walkin' in my sleep
             Em                      C
Countin' troubles 'stead of countin' sheep
            G               Em
Where the years went I can't say
        C            D                 G
I just turned around and they've gone away
 
            G
I've been siftin' through the layers
          Em               C
Of dusty books and faded papers
             G               Em
They tell a story I used to know
           C               D         G
And it was one that happened so long ago
 
         G
It's gone away in yesterday
   Em                    C
Now I find myself on the moutainside
          G             Em
Where the rivers change direction
C     D         G
Across the Great Divide
 
        G
Now, I hear the owl a-callin'
        Em             C
Softly as the night was fallin'
            G          Em
With a question and I replied
           C        D     G
But he's gone across the borderline
 
         G
He's gone away in yesterday
   Em                    C
Now I find myself on the moutainside
          G             Em
Where the rivers change direction
C     D         G
Across the Great Divide
 
(solo)

             G
The finest hour that I have seen
          Em          C
Is the one that comes between
            G                   Em
The edge of night and the break of day
C                     D          G
It's when the darkness rolls away
 
         G
It's gone away in yesterday
   Em                    C
Now I find myself on the moutainside
          G             Em
Where the rivers change direction
 C     D         G
Across the Great Divide
 
         G
It's gone away in yesterday
   Em                    C
Now I find myself on the moutainside
          G             Em
Where the rivers change direction
 C     D         G
Across the Great Divide
