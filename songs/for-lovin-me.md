[D]That's what you [D7]get for lovin' [G]me.

[G]Everything you had is [Em]gone, as you can [A]see..
[D]That's what you [D7]get for lovin' [G]me.

[D]I ain't the [D7]kind to hang [G]around.
[D]With any [D7]new love that I've [Em]fou.ou.[D]nd.
[G]Movin' is my stock-in-[Em]trade..I'm movin' [A]on..
[D]I won't think [D7]of you when I'm [G]gone.

[D]So, don't you [D7]shed a tear for [G]me.
[D]I ain't the [D7]love you thought I'd [Em]be.e.[D]e.
[G]I got a hundred more like [Em]you..so don't be [A]blue.
[D]I'll have a [D7]thousand 'fore I'm [G]through.

[D]Now there you [D7]go, you're cryin' [G]again.
[D]Now there you [D7]go, you're cryin' [Em]again.n.[D]n.
[G]But then someday when your poor [Em]heart, is on the [A]mend..
[D]I just might [D7]pass this way [G]again.

[D]That's what you [D7]get for lovin' [G]me.
[D]That's what you [D7]get lovin' [Em]me.e.[D]e.
[G]Everything you had is [Em]gone, as you can [A]see..
[D]That's what you [D7]get for lovin' [G]me.

[D]That's what you [D7]get for lovin' [G]me.
[D]That's what you [D7]get lovin' [Em]me.e.[D]e.
[G]Everything you had is [Em]gone, as you can [A]see..
[D]That's what you [D7]get for lovin' [G]me.
