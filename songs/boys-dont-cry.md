A               B
I would say I'm sorry 
       C#m                   D
If I thought that it would change your mind 
 A               Bm
But I know that this time 
        C#m                 D
I have said too much, been too unkind 

C#m         Bm            C#m                   Bm
  I try to laugh about it cover it all up with lies 

C#m         Bm            C#m                     Bm
  I try to laugh about it hiding the tears in my eyes 

        A    Bm   C#m  D D C#m Bm
'Cause boys don't cry
 A    Bm   C#m  D D C#m Bm
Boys don't cry 

A                  Bm
I would break down at your feet 
    C#m              D
And beg forgiveness plead with you 
 A               Bm
But I know that it's too late 
    C#m                 D
And now there's nothing I can do 

C#m            Bm             C#m                   Bm
  So I try to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies 
C#m         Bm             C#m                     Bm
  I try to laugh about it, hiding the tears in my eyes 

       A    Bm   C#m  D D C#m Bm
'Cause boys don't cry
 A    Bm   C#m  D D C#m Bm
Boys don't cry 

A                 Bm
I would tell you that I loved you
C#m                D
If I thought that you would stay 
 A               Bm
But I know that it's no use 
     C#m            D
And you're already gone away 

E               F#m7
 Misjudged your limits 
E               F#m7
 Pushed you too far 
E             F#m7
 Took you for granted 
D                             E
 I thought that you needed me more more more

    A               Bm
Now I would do most anything 
   C#m                 D
To get you back by my side 
 A          Bm
But I just keep on laughing
C#m                     D
Hiding the tears in my eyes 


         A  Bm      C#m  D D C#m Bm
'Cause boys   don't cry
 A    Bm   C#m  D D C#m Bm
Boys don't cry 
A Bm           C#m  D D C#m Bm
     Boys don't cry
