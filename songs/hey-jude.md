Hey [D]Jude, don’t make it [A]bad, take a [A7]sad song and make it [D]better
Re[G]member to let her into your [D]heart, then you can s[A]tart to [A7]make it [D]better

Hey [D]Jude, don’t be a[A]fraid, you were [A7]made to go out and [D]get her
The [G]minute you let her under your [D]skin, then you be[A]gin to [A7]make it [D]better

[D7]And anytime you feel the [G]pain, hey [Bm]Jude, re[Em]frain, don’t [G]carry the [A7]world upon your [D]shoulders
[D7]For well you know that it's a [G]fool who [Bm]plays it [Em]cool by [G]making his [A7]world a little [D]colder

[D]Da da da [D7]da da [A7]da da da

Hey [D]Jude, don’t let me [A]down, you have [A7]found her, now go and [D]get her
Re[G]member to let her into your [D]heart, then you can [A]start to [A7]make it [D]better

[D7]So let it out and let it [G]in, hey [Bm]Jude, be[Em]gin, you're [G]waiting for [A7]someone to per[D]form with
[D7]And don’t you know that it's just [G]you, hey [Bm]Jude, you'll [Em]do, the [G]movement you [A7]need is on your [D]shoulders

[D]Da da da [D7]da da [A7]da da da

Hey [D]Jude, don’t make it [A]bad, take a [A7]sad song and make it [D]better
Re[G]member to let her under your [D]skin, then you be[A]gin to [A7]make it [D]better
