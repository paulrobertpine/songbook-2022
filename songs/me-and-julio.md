The mama pajama rolled out of bed,
                          D
and she ran to the police station
         E
When the papa found out, he began to shout,
                          A
and he started the investigation
 
                 E
It's against the law;
                   A
it was against the law
              E
What the mama saw;
                   A
it was against the law
 
    A
The mama looked down and spit on the ground,
                        D
every time my name gets mentioned
    E
The papa said oy, if I get that boy,
                                      A
I'm gonna stick him in the house of detention
 
               D
Well I'm on my way;
             A
I don't know where I'm going
          D                  A
I'm on my way, I'm taking my time;
      B7         E
but I don't know where
           D          G          A
Goodbye to Rosie, the queen of Corona
       A      G

down by the schoolyard
       A      G

Whoa, in a couple of days, they come and take me away,
                            D
but the press let the story leak
             E
Now when the radical priest, come to get me released,
                           A

Well I'm on my way;
