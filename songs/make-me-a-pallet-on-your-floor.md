[G]

[C]Make me down a pallet on your [G]floor
[C]Make me down a pallet on your [D7]floor
[G]Make me [B7]down a [C]pallet soft and low
[G]When I'm broke and I [D7]got nowhere to [G]go

Been hanging 'round with a good-time friends of mine
Hanging around with a good-time friends of mine
Oh, they treat me very nice and kind
When I've got a dollar and a dime

We're in blues everywhere I see
We're in blues everywhere I see
We're in blues, honey, everywhere I see
No one ever had the blues like me

Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Come tomorrow, I'll be satisfied
If I can catch that fast train and ride

So, make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down a pallet soft and low
Babe, I'm broke and I got nowhere to go
