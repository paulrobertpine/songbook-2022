I'm gonna [Em]fight 'em off[G][C][B]
A seven nation [Em]army couldn't [G]hold me [C]back[B]
They're gonna [Em]rip it off[G][C][B]
Taking their [Em]time right be[G]hind my [C]back[B]
And I'm [Em]talking to my[G]self at [C]night
Because I [B]can't for[Em]get[G][C][B]
[Em]Back and forth [G]through my [C]mind
Behind a [B]ciga[Em]rette[G][C][B]
And a [G]message coming from my [A]eyes says leave it alone

[Em] [G] [C] [B] x8
[Am] [B][E]

[Verse 2]
Don't want[Em] to hear about[G] i[C]t[B]
Every single on[Em]e's got a stor[G]y to tel[C]l[B]
Everyone k[Em]nows about it[G][C][B]
From the Queen [Em]of England to [G]the houn[C]ds of[B]Hell
And if I c[Em]atch it coming[G] b[C]ac[B]k my way
I'm gonna serve[Em] it to you[G][C][B]
And that a[Em]in't what you [G]wa[C]nt[B]to hear
But that's what[Em] I'll do[G][C][B]
And a [G]feeling coming from my [A]bones says find a home

[Em] [G] [C] [B] x8
[Am] [B][E]

I'm going [Em]to Wichita[G][C][B]
Far from this o[Em]pera, forever [G]more[C][B]
I'm going [Em]to work the st[G]ra[C]w[B]
Make the sweat [Em]drip out of ev[G]ery pore[C][B]
And I'm bl[Em]eeding and I'm[G] b[C]le[B]eding and I'm bleeding
Right before th[Em]e Lord[G][C][B]
All the wo[Em]rds are going [G]to[C] b[B]leed from me
And I will thin[Em]k no more[G][C][B]
And the [G]stains coming from my [A]blood tell me go back home
