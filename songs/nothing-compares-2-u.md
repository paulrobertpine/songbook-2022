[F]It's been seven hours and [C]fifteen days
[Dm]since you took your love away[F][C]
[F]I go out every night and [C]sleep all day
[Dm]since you took your love away[F][C]
[F]Since you been gone I can do what-[C]ever I want
[Dm]I can see whomever I choose[F][C]
[F]I can eat my dinner in a fancy [C]restaurant
but [Dm]nothing, I said nothing can take [A]away these blues

'cos
[Eb]nothing com-[Bb]pares
[Eb]nothing com-[Bb]pares 2 U [C]

[F]It's been so lonely with-[C]out U here
[Dm]like a bird without a song[F][C]
[F]nothing can stop these lonely [C]tears from falling
tell me [Dm]baby where did I go [Bb]wrong?
[F]I could put my arms around every [C]boy I see
[Dm]but they only remind me of U.[F][C]
[F]I went to the doctor and guess what he [C]told me guess what he told me
he said: [Dm]"girl U better try to have fun no matter [A]what U do"
but he's a fool

'cos
[Eb]nothing com-[Bb]pares
[Dm]nothing com-[C]pares 2 U

(solo on verse)

[F]All the flowers that U planted mama
[C]in the back yard
[Dm]all died when U went away[F][C]
[F]I know that living with U baby was [C]sometimes hard
[Dm]but I'm willing 2 give U another [A]try

'cos
[Eb]nothing com-[Bb]pares
[Dm]nothing com-[C]pares 2 U
(x3)
