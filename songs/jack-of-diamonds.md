I've played cards in England
I've gambled in Spain
Goin back to Carolina
Gonna play my last game

chorus
Jack of diamonds, jack of diamonds
I've known you from old
You've robbed my poor pockets
Of silver and gold

Gonna eat when I'm hungry
Gonna drink when I'm dry
Get to feelin much better
Gonna sprout wings and fly

Gonna take down my fiddle
Gonna rosin up the bow
Gonna make myself welcome
Wherever I go

chorus

Gonna drink, gonna gamble
All my money is my own
Them that don't like me
Can leave me alone

Gonna beat on the counter
Gonna make the glass ring
More brandy, more brandy
More brandy to bring

chorus

If the river was whiskey
And I was a duck
I'd dive to the bottom
And never come up

But the river ain't whiskey
And I ain't no duck
I'll play these drunkard's hiccups
And trust to my luck

chorus
