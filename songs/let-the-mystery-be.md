[D]Everybody is [G]wonderin' what and [A]where they all came [D]from
Everybody is [G]worryin' 'bout where they're gonna [A]go
When the whole thing's [D]done
But no one knows for [G]certain, and so it's [D]all the same to [G]me
[D]I think I'll just [A] let the mystery [D]be.

Some say once gone you're [G]gone forever
And [A]some say you're gonna come [D]back
Some [D]say you rest in the [G]arms of the Saviour
If in [A]sinful ways you [D]lack
Some [D]say that they're comin' [G]back in a garden
Bunch of [D]carrots and little sweet [G]peas
[D]I think I'll just [A] let the mystery [D]be.

[D]Everybody is [G]wonderin' what and [A]where they all came [D]from
Everybody is [G]worryin' 'bout where they're gonna [A]go
When the whole thing's [D]done
But no one knows for [G]certain, and so it's [D]all the same to [G]me
[D]I think I'll just [A] let the mystery [D]be.

Some say they're goin' to a [G]place called Glory
And I a[A]in't sayin' it ain't a [D]fact
But I've h[D]eard that I'm on the r[G]oad to purgatory
And I [A]don't like the sound of t[D]hat
[D]I believe in [G]love and I live my [D]life according[G]ly
[D]But I choose [A]to let the mystery [D]be.

[D]Everybody is [G]wonderin' what and [A]where they all came [D]from
Everybody is [G]worryin' 'bout where they're gonna [A]go
When the whole thing's [D]done
But no one knows for [G]certain, and so it's [D]all the same to [G]me
[D]I think I'll just [A] let the mystery [D]be.
