[Intro]
[Bm] [A][E]

[Verse 1]
[Bm]The world was on fire and n[A]o one could save me but [E]you.
[Bm]It's strange what desire will [A]make foolish people d[E]o.
[Bm]I never dreamed that I'[A]d meet somebody like y[E]ou.
[Bm]I never dreamed that I'[A]d lose somebody like y[E]ou.

[Chorus]
No, [Bm]I d[A]on't want to fall in[E]love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, [Bm]I d[A]on't want to fall in[E]love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you.         With you.       (This world is only gonna break your heart)

[Verse 2]
[Bm]What a wicked g[A]ame to play,[E]to make me feel this way.
[Bm]What a wicked thi[A]ng to do,[E]to let me dream of you.
[Bm]What a wicked th[A]ing to say,[E]you never felt this way.
[Bm]What a wicked th[A]ing to do,[E]to make me dream of you.

[Chorus]
And, [Bm]I d[A]on't want to fall in[E]love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
No, [Bm]I d[A]on't want to fall in[E]love. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
With you.

[Bm]I never dreamed that I'[A]d lose somebody like y[E]ou, no

[Chorus]
[Bm]No,[A] I want to fall in l[E]ove. (This world is only gonna break your heart)
