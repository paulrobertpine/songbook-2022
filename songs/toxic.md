[Am]

[Am]Baby, can’t you see
[Am]I’m calling
[Am]A guy like you
[Am]Should wear a warning
[C]It’s dangerous
[E]I’m fallin’
[Am]

[Am]There’s no escape
[Am]I can’t wait
[Am]I need a hit
[Am]Baby, give me it
[C]You’re dangerous
[E]I’m lovin’ it
[Am]

[Am]Too high
[Am]Can’t come down
[Am]Losing my head
[Am]Spinning ‘round and ‘round
[C][E]Do you feel me now

[Am]


With a [Am]taste of your lips
I’m[C]on a ride
[F]You're toxic [E]I'm slipping under
With a [Am]taste of a poison [C]paradise
I’m [F]addicted to you
Don’t you [E]know that you’re toxic
[Am][C](riff)
And I [F]love what you do
Don’t you [E]know that you’re toxic

(Instrumental)

[Am][C][F][E]


[Am]It’s getting late
[Am]To give you up
[Am]I took a sip
[Am]From my devil's cup
[C]Slowly
[E]It’s taking over me
[Am]


[Am]Too high
[Am]Can’t come down
[Am]It’s in the air
[Am]And it’s all around
[C][E]Can you feel me now

[Am]

With a [Am]taste of your lips
I’m[C]on a ride
[F]You're toxic [E]I'm slipping under
With a [Am]taste of a poison [C]paradise
I’m [F]addicted to you
Don’t you [E]know that you’re toxic
[Am][C](riff)
And I [F]love what you do
Don’t you [E]know that you’re toxic

(Instrumental)

[Am][C][F]Don't you [E]know that you're toxic

(bridge)
[|Am|C|B|Bb|]
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[|Am|C|F|E|]

[N.C.]
TASTE OF YOUR LIPS I'M ON A RIDE

[Am][Am][Am][C]

(Bridge)
[F]You're toxic [E]I'm slipping under
With a [Am]taste of a poison [C]paradise
I'm [F]addicted to you
Don't you [E]know that you're toxic

(chorus)

(Outro)
[Am]Intoxicate me now
[C]With your lovin' now
[B]I think I'm ready now
[Bb]I think I'm ready now
[Am]Intoxicate me now
[C]With your lovin' now
[F]I think I'm ready now
[E]I think I'm ready now
