[Intro]
C  G   C  G  D  G  D   G

[Verse]
C   G   C        G
 Tarzan wasn't a ladies' man
C          G              C            G         Em
 He'd just come along and scoop 'em up under his arm
     D     Em         D          Am      D
Like that, quick as a cat in the jungle

C      G         C           G
 Clark Kent, now there was a real gent
C         G             C        G
 He would not be caught sittin' around in no
Em     D     Em         D           Am       D
Junglescape, dumb as an ape doing nothing

[Chorus]
C               D
 Superman never made any money
    G          Am7        C
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy
    G           C             G                C
And   sometimes I despair the world will never see
        D
Another man like him

[Verse]
C    G    C          G
 Hey Bob, Supe had a straight job
C     G                    C                   G
 Even though he could have smashed through any bank
        Em    D       Em         D                Am         D
In the United States, he had the strength, but he would not

C      G        C           G
 Folks said his family were all dead
C       G            C            G
 Planet crumbled but Superman, he forced himself
   Em    D      Em      D             Am      D
To carry on, forget Krypton, and keep going

[Chorus]
C               D
 Superman never made any money
    G          Am7        C
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy
    G           C             G                C
And   sometimes I despair the world will never see
        D
Another man like him

[Bridge]
Em  D       Em          D          C                 G D
 Tarzan was king of the jungle and Lord over all the apes
Em   D        Em     D              C     G                      D
 But he could hardly string together four words: "I Tarzan, You  Jane."

[Verse]
C    G          C        G
 Sometimes when Supe was stopping crimes
C     G               C               G                 Em
 I'll bet that he was tempted to just quit and turn his back
   D    Em      D          Am     D
On man, join Tarzan in the forest

C    G  C             G     C        G
 But he stayed in the city,  kept on changing clothes
   C         G                    Em       D
In dirty old phonebooths till his work was through
    Em         D         Am        D
And nothing to do but go on home

[Chorus]
C               D
 Superman never made any money
    G          Am7        C
For saving the world from Solomon Grundy
    G           C             G                C
And   sometimes I despair the world will never see
        D
Another man like him

    G           C             G                C
And   sometimes I despair the world will never see
        D
Another man like him
