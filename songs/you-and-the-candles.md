whe[C]n soci[C]eties crumble[F] and everything’[C]s gone
when the [C]cars are all [C]rusted away [F][f]
there [C]ain’t no m[C]ore money and there is[F] nothing to buy [C]
and a[F]ll that[F] we have is t[G]he day[G]

when the [C]world becomes silent no [F]planes in the [C]air
and the voices just gather to [F]sing
the [C]guns are the fence post the [F]cars are the [C]dog house
and the [F]telephones no longer [G]ring

but [F]what, what of the [C]night
with [F]no electrical [C]lig[G/B]ht[F]
so what [G]then

[C]you, you and the can[F]dles [C/E]will be all t[Dm]hat I nee[Dm]d[G][g]
your [C]fac[C]e bathed in t[F]he fire l[C/E]ight will [Dm]be all i w[Dm]ant to se[G]e[G]
and I[F]’ll sti[F]ll write you[G] a song [G]
[E]that will la[E]st the whole night lon[Am]g[G]
[F]you, you and the candles[G]

the [C]grocery stores are [F]hollow in-[C]side 
the [C]airports all filled with the [F]breeze
[C]after the anarchy [F]finally sub-[C]sides
will you [F]reckon with how it will [G]be

when [C]empires are humble before the [F]eyes of the [C]people
and the [C]truth will be like a pa-[F]rade
when [C]industries fallen we’ll [F]make our own [C]clothes now 
and [F]gifts of our hands rise a-[G]gain

but [F]what, what of the [C]night
with [F]no electrical [C]lig[G/B]ht[F]
so what [G]then

[C]you, you and the can[F]dles [C/E]will be all t[Dm]hat I nee[Dm]d[G][g]
your [C]fac[C]e bathed in t[F]he fire l[C/E]ight will [Dm]be all i w[Dm]ant to se[G]e[G]
and I[F]’ll sti[F]ll write you[G] a song [G]
[E]that will la[E]st the whole night lon[Am]g[G]
[F]you, you and the candles[G]

in a [Dm]waste pa[Dm]per basket the[Bb] timi[Bb]ng is fantastic
for [F]lovers to me[F]an what they say [C][c]
and a [Dm]night lit in cand[Dm]les on stain w[Bb]ooden mantels [Bb]
keep us [G]safe till the nigh[G]t turns to day[C][c]

[F]you, you[F] and the sto[Bb]rm clouds [Bb7]and the puddles[Gm] at our fee[Gm]t[C][c]
the [F]lightning cu[F]ts through the heave[Bb]ns and lig[Bb7]ht you so[Gm] briefly[Gm][c][C]
and [Bb]i’ll st[Bb]ill write you[C] a song[C]
that will [A]last the whol[A]e night long[Dm][c]
[Bb]you, you[Bb] and th[Bb]e candl[Bb]es[C][c][C][c]
[Bb]you, you[Bb] and th[Bb]e candl[Bb]es[C][c][C][c]
