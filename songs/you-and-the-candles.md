whe[C]n soci[C]eties crumble[F] and everything’[C]s gone
when the [C]cars are all [C]rusted away [F][F]
there [C]ain’t no m[C]ore money and there is[F] nothing to buy [C]
and a[F]ll that[F] we have is t[G]he day[G]

when the world becomes silent no planes in the air
and the voices just gather to sing
the guns are the fence post the cars are the dog house
and the telephones no longer ring

pre-chorus
but [F]what, wh[F]at of the nig[C]ht[C]
with n[F]o [F]electric[C]al lig[G/B]ht[F][F]
so what t[G]hen

chorus
[C]you, you[C] and the can[F]dles [C]will be all t[Dm]hat I nee[Dm]d[G][G]
your [C]fac[C]e bathed in t[F]he fire l[C]ight will [Dm]be all i w[Dm]ant to se[G]e[G]
and I[F]’ll sti[F]ll write you[G] a song [G]
[E]that will la[E]st the whole night lon[Am]g[G]
[FFF]you, you[F] and the cand[G]le[G]s[G][G]

the grocery stores are hollow inside the airports all filled with the breeze
after the anarchy finally subsides
will you reckon with how it will be
when empires are humble before the eyes of the people
and the  truth will be like a parade
when industries fallen we’ll make our own clothes now and gifts of our hands rise again

chorus
in a [Dm]waste pa[Dm]per basket the[Bb] timi[Bb]ng is fantastic
for [F]lovers to me[F]an what they say [C][C]
and a [Dm]night lit in cand[Dm]les on stain w[Bb]ooden mantels [Bb]
keep us [G]safe till the nigh[G]t turns to day[C][C]

[F]you, you[F] and the sto[Bb]rm clouds [Bb7]and the puddles[Gm] at our fee[Gm]t[C][C]
the [F]lightning cu[F]ts through the heave[Bb]ns and lig[Bb7]ht you so[Gm] briefly[Gm][C][C]
and [Bb]i’ll st[Bb]ill write you[C] a song[C]
that will [A]last the whol[A]e night long[Dm][C]
[Bb]you, you[Bb] and th[Bb]e candl[Bb]es[C][C][C][C]
[Bb]you, you[Bb] and th[Bb]e candl[Bb]es[C][C][C][C]
