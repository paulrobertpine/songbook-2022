Intro:
D  A  G
 
D  Am7  G
 
D         A     G
Here you come again
D               A            G
Just when I'd begun to get myself together
Bm                      Em
You waltz right in the door
Bm                      Em
Just like you've done before
     G                           A
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger
 
D         A     G
Here you come again
D               A               G
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
Bm                Em
You look into my eyes
Bm                    Em
And lie those pretty lies
      G
And pretty soon I'm wondering' how I
          A
 came to doubt you
 
Dm                    C
All you got to do is smile that smile
     Bb                F
And there go all my defenses
       F                        C   Am
Just leave it up to you and in a little
     G
while
         E                       A
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
 
D         A     G
Here you come again
   D              A          G
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
Bm                Em    Bm
And shakin' me up so that all I really
 Em
 know
   G                     A
Is here you come again
            D     A    G
And here I go
        D
Here I go
 
D  A  G  D  A  G  Bm  Em  Bm  Em  G  A  D  A  G  D
 
Dm                    C
All you got to do is smile that smile
     Bb                F
And there go all my defenses
       F                      C    Am
Just leave it up to you and in a little
     G
while
         E                      A
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses
 
D          A    G
Here you come again
D                    A            G
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
Bm                 Em
And shakin' me up so
Bm                 Em
That all I really know
    G                    A
Is here you come again
            D   A   G
And here I go
        D   A   G
Here I go
            D   A   G
And here I go
            D   A   G
And here I go
D    A   G
Here you come again
            D   A   G
And here I go
        D   A   G
Here I go
            D   A   G
And here I go
         D   A   G
Here I go
