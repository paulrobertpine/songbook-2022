[Em]

[Em]I don’t know what you’[G]ve been tol[C]d
[Em]But I don’t get out muc[G]h these day[D]s[C]
[Em]Waking young and fee[G]ling old
The [C]days are no longer my own
To [Em]piss away the [G]waking hou[D]rs[C]

But [Em]don’t, don’t, don’t
Don’t [C]let them go
[Em]Don’t, don’t, don’t
Don’t [C]let them go to was[G]te
The fire in my [D]eye is fleeting [Em]now
Your robot [C]heart is bleeding

[Em]Tried to be the [G]robot [C]king
[Em]And settled for a [G]robot [D]boy[C]
[Em]Ring the bells that [G]still can ring
And [C]sing your stupid head off to
[Em]The ones who a[G]re not [D]liste[C]ning

And [G]I've spend half of my [D]life
In the customer service [Em]line
Flaws in the desig[C]n
A sign of the time[G]s

And that little vo[D]ice
In the back of your [Em]mind
Just wants you to kno[C]w
Just hopes that you kno[C]w

[G]Robots need love [D]too
They want to be loved by [Em]you
They want to be loved by [C]you.
They want to be loved [G]by
(repeat indefinitely)
