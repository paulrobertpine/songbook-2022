[Intro]
[D] [C7+9][EbM7/F][Bb]
(repeat)

[Verse]
[D]Got a call from an [D/F#]old friend
We used to be re[G]al close
[A]Said he couldn't go on the American [D]way
Closed the shop, sold the h[D/F#]ouse
Bought a ticket to the W[G]est Coast
[A]Now he gives them a stand-up routine in L.A.

[Instrumental]
[D] [C7+9][EbM7/F][Bb]
(repeat)

[Chorus]
[D]I don't need you to[D/F#] worry for me cause I'm [G]alright
[A]   I don't want you to tell me it's time to come [D]home
[D]I don't care what y[D/F#]ou say anymore, this is [G]my life
[A]   Go ahead with your own life, and leave [Bm]me alone

[Bridge]
[Bm]I never said you had to offer me a s[F#7/C#]econd chance
[D]I never said I was a victim of ci[Esus]rcumstance[E]
[G]I still be[D/F#]long,  [F#]   don't get m[Bm]e wrong
[E7+9]And you can speak your mind
But [G/A]not   [A]on  [G/A]my   [A]time

[Verse]
[D]They will tell you [D/F#]you can't sleep
Alone in a stran[G]ge place
[A]Then they'll tell you you can't sleep with somebody [D]else
[D]But sooner or later you slee[D/F#]p
In your [G]own space
[A]Either way it's okay to wake up with yourself

[Chorus]
[D]I don't need you to [D/F#]worry for me cause I'm [G]alright
[A]   I don't want you to tell me it's time to come [D]home
[D]I don't care what you [D/F#]say anymore, this is [G]my life
[A]   Go ahead with your own life, and leave me [Bm]alone

[Bridge]
[Bm]I never said you had to offer me a s[F#7/C#]econd chance
[D]I never said I was a victim of ci[Esus]rcumstance[E]
[G]I still be[D/F#]long,  [F#]   don't get me [Bm]wrong
[E7+9]And you can speak your mind
But [G/A]not   [A]on  [G/A]my   [A]time

[Solo]
[D] [D/F#][G][A][D]

[Chorus]
[D]I don't care what you [D/F#]say anymore, this is [G]my life
[A]Go ahead with your own life, and leave me alo[D]ne
