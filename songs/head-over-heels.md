Aadd9  A              Cmaj7     C
       I wanted to be with you alone
Aadd9  A                  Cmaj7    C
       and talk about the weather
       Aadd9     A                     Cmaj7          C
But traditions I can trace against the child in your face
Aadd9       A              Cmaj7  C
      Won't escape my attention
Aadd9    A                    Cmaj7      C
You keep your distance with a system of touch
Aadd9  A                Cmaj7  C
       and gentle persuasion
    Aadd9     A                Cmaj7         C
I'm lost in admiration could I need you this much?
          Aadd9      A                 Cmaj7  C
Oh you're wasting my time, you're just, just, just wasting time
 
G                         Em
Something happens and I'm head over heels
        G                 Em
I never find out 'til I'm head over heels
G                         Em
Something happens and I'm head over heels
          Dm7
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
 N.C.
Don't, don't, don't throw it away
Aadd9  A  Cmaj7     C
          throw it away,
Aadd9  A  Cmaj7     C
          throw it away!
 
Aadd9   A                Cmaj7       C
      I made a fire, I'm watching it burn
Aadd9  A                  Cmaj7    C
  Yeah! Thought of your future
     Aadd9       A                      Cmaj7        C
With one foot in the past, now just how long will it last
     Aadd9 A               Cmaj7     C
No, no, no have you no ambition
                                 (What's the matter with my)
   Aadd9      A                   Cmaj7           C
My mother and my brothers used to breathing clean air
                              (Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age)
Aadd9  A                  Cmaj7       C
       and dreaming I'm a doctor
                        (Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby)
     Aadd9      A                    Cmaj7       C
It's hard to be a man when there's a gun in your hand
                                  (Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age)
    Aadd9  A  Cmaj7 C
Oh, I   feel   so - oh
 
G                         Em
Something happens and I'm head over heels
        G                 Em
I never find out 'til I'm head over heels
G                         Em
Something happens and I'm head over heels
          Dm7
Ah, don't take my heart, don't break my heart
 N.C.
Don't, don't, don't throw it away
 
C                D
      This is my four leaf clover
  C
I'm on the line, one open mind
          D
This is my four leaf clover
 
C                                     D
La, la la la, la,  La la la la, la,   La, la, La, la, La la
C                                     D
La, la la la, la,  La la la la, la,   La, la, La, la, La la
C                                     D
La, la la la, la,  La la la la, la,   La, la, La, la, La la
C                                     D
La, la la la, la,  La la la la, la,   La, la, La, la, La la
C                                     D
La, la la la, la,  La la la la, la,   La, la, La, la, La la
                                In my  minds's eye
C                                           D
La, la la la, la,  La la la la, la
