[Aadd9] [A]I wanted to be [Cmaj7]with you a[C]lone
[Aadd9] [A]and talk about the [Cmaj7]weather[C]
But tra[Aadd9]ditions I [A]can trace against the [Cmaj7]child in your f[C]ace
[Aadd9] Won't [A]escape my atten[Cmaj7]tion[C]
[Aadd9]You keep [A]your distance with a [Cmaj7]system of t[C]ouch
[Aadd9] [A]and gentle persua[Cmaj7]sion[C]
I'm [Aadd9]lost in ad[A]miration could I [Cmaj7]need you this [C]much?
Oh you're [Aadd9]wasting my [A]time, you're just,[Cmaj7] just, [C]just wasting time

[G]Something happens and I'm [Em]head over heels
I never [G]find out 'til I'm [Em]head over heels
[G]Something happens and I'm [Em]head over heels
Ah, don't [Dm7]take my heart, don't break my heart
N.C.
Don't, don't, don't throw it away
[Aadd9] [A] [Cmaj7]throw it a[C]way,
[Aadd9] [A] [Cmaj7]throw it a[C]way!

[Aadd9] I [A]made a fire, I'm [Cmaj7]watching it [C]burn
[Aadd9] Yeah![A] Thought of your fu[Cmaj7]ture[C]
With [Aadd9]one foot in [A]the past, now just how [Cmaj7]long will it [C]last
No, n[Aadd9]o, no [A]have you no ambi[Cmaj7]tion[C]
(What's the matter with my)
My [Aadd9]mother and [A]my brothers used to [Cmaj7]breathing clean [C]air
(Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age)
[Aadd9] [A]and dreaming I'm a [Cmaj7]doctor[C]
(Nothing gets done when you feel like a baby)
It's [Aadd9]hard to be [A]a man when there's a [Cmaj7]gun in your [C]hand
(Nothing ever changes when you're acting your age)
Oh, [Aadd9]I fee[A]l [Cmaj7] so - [C]oh

[G]Something happens and I'm [Em]head over heels
I never [G]find out 'til I'm [Em]head over heels
[G]Something happens and I'm [Em]head over heels
Ah, don't [Dm7]take my heart, don't break my heart
N.C.
Don't, don't, don't throw it away

[C] This is my [D]four leaf clover
I'[C]m on the line, one open mind
This is my[D]four leaf clover

[C]La, la la la, la, La la la la, la, [D]La, la, La, la, La la
[C]La, la la la, la, La la la la, la, [D]La, la, La, la, La la
[C]La, la la la, la, La la la la, la, [D]La, la, La, la, La la
[C]La, la la la, la, La la la la, la, [D]La, la, La, la, La la
[C]La, la la la, la, La la la la, la, [D]La, la, La, la, La la
In my minds's eye
[C]La, la la la, la, La la la la, la[D]
One little boy, one little man, funny how time flies
