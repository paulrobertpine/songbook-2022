[G] Close your [D]eyes
[Em] And I'll sing you a so[C]ng
[G] Lullaby[D][em] Sleep till morning [C]comes

[Am] The crickets sere[D]nade
[Bm] Echoes softly through the n[C]ight
[Am] The stars are on the l[D]ake
[Bm] And the moon is shining br[C]ight [D]Don't worry

[G] I'll leave the light on in the[D]hall
[C] Just go to [D]sleep now close your [G]eyes

[G] Close your e[D]yes
[Em] Listen to my [C]song
[G] Lullab[D]y
[C]Sleep until the dawn

[Am] The birds are in their [D]nest
[Bm] And the cows are in the b[C]arn
[Am] The covers on your b[D]ed
[Bm] Will keep you safe and wa[C]rm [D]Don't worry

[G] I'll be beside you should you[D]fall
[C] Just go to [D]sleep now close your [G]eyes

[Em] Dragons in the s[C]ky

[Em] And If you catch their [C]eye

[C] Just go to [D]sleep now close your [G]eyes
