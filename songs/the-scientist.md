[Intro]
|Bm7   |G     |D     |Dsus2 | x2

[Verse]
[Bm7]   Come up to me[G]et you, tell you I'm s[D]orry
You don't know how l[Dsus2]ovely you are
[Bm7]   I had to find[G] you, tell you I need[D]you,
Tell you I’ll [Dsus2]set you apart
[Bm7]   Tell me your se[G]crets, and’ask me your ques[D]tions
Oh, let’s go ba[Dsus2]ck to the start
[Bm7]   Running in ci[G]rcles, coming up ta[D]ils,
Heads on a scie[Dsus2]nce apart

[Chorus]
[G]Nobody said it was easy
[D]  It's such a [Dsus2]shame for us to part
[G]Nobody said it was easy
[D]  No one ever [A/D]said it would be [D6/9]this har[A/E]d.[Asus4][A]
N.C.
Oh take me back to the start...

[Instrumental]
|D     |G     |D     |D Dmaj7 |
|Bm7   |G     |D     |Dsus2   |

[Verse]
[Bm7]   I was just gue[G]ssing at numbers and fi[D]gures
Pulling the puzzl[Dsus2]es apart
[Bm7]   Questions of sci[G]ence, science and pro[D]gress
Do not speak as lou[Dsus2]d as my heart
[Bm7]   Tell me you lov[G]e me, come back and haunt[D]me
Oh, and I rush [Dsus2]to the start
[Bm7]   Running in ci[G]rcles, chasing our ta[D]ils
Coming back as we [Dsus2/C#]are

[Chorus]
[G]Nobody said it was easy
[D]  Oh, it’s such a [Dsus2]shame for us to part
[G]Nobody said it was easy
[D]  No one ever [A/D]said it would be [D6/9]so har[A/E]d.[Asus4][A]
N.C.
I’m going back to the start.
