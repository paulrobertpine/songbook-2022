[E]I can see her lyin' back in her satin dress
In a [B7]room where ya do what ya [E]don't confess

Sundown ya [A]better take care
If I [D]find you've been creepin' 'ro[E]und my back stairs
Sundown ya [A]better take care
If I [D]find you've been creepin' 'ro[E]und my back stairs

[E]She's bin lookin' like a queen in a sailor's dream
And she [B7]don't always say what she [E]really means

Sometimes I [A]think it's a shame
When I [D]get feelin' better when I'm [E]feelin' no pain
Sometimes I [A]think it's a shame
When I [D]get feelin' better when I'm [E]feelin' no pain

[E]I can picture every move that a man could make
Getting [B7]lost in her lovin' is your [E]first mistake

Sundown ya [A]better take care
If I [D]find you've been creepin' 'ro[E]und my back stairs

Sometimes I [A]think it's a sin
When I [D]feel like I'm winnin' when I'm [E]losin again

Instrumental break

[E]I can see her lookin' fast in her faded jeans
She's a [B7]hard lovin' woman, got me [E]feelin' mean

Sometimes I [A]think it's a shame
When I [D]get feelin' better when I'm [E]feelin' no pain

Sundown ya [A]better take care
If I [D]find you've been creepin' 'ro[E]und my back stairs
Sundown ya [A]better take care
If I [D]find you've been creepin' 'ro[E]und my back stairs

Sometimes I [A]think it's a sin
When I [D]feel like I'm winnin' when I'm [E]losin' again
