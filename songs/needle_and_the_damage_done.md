[D] [C][Cadd9][G][Gm][Bb][C][F][Esus4][E][2x]

[D]I caught you knocking at my [C]cellar [Cadd9]door
[G]I love you, baby, can I [Gm]have some [Bb]more
[C]Ooh, [F]ooh, the damage [Esus4]done.[E]

[D]I hit the city and I [C]lost my [Cadd9]band
[G]I watched the needle take a[Gm]nother [Bb]man
[C]Gone, [F]gone, the damage [Esus4]done.[E]

[D] [C][Cadd9][G][Gm][Bb][C][F][Esus4][E]

[D]I sing the song because I [C]love the [Cadd9]man
[G]I know that some of you don't [Gm]under[Bb]stand
[C]Milk-[F]blood to keep from [Esus4]running [E]out.

[D]I've seen the needle and the [C]damage [Cadd9]done
[G]A little part of it in [Gm]every[Bb]one
[C]But every junkies like a [F]setting [Esus4]sun.[E]

[D] [C][Cadd9][G][Gm][Bb]
