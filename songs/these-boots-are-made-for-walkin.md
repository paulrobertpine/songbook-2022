You keep sayin', you've got somethin' for me,
E
Somethin' you call love, but confess
A
You've been a-messin' where you shouldn't have been a-messin',
        E
And now someone else is gettin' all your best
 
      G                   E
These boots are made for walkin'
    G                        E
And that's just what they'll do,
G                       E                        E
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin',
    E7
And you keep losin' when you oughta not bet
A7
You keep samein' when you ought to be a-changin',
           E7
Now what's right is right but you ain't been right yet
 
 
      G                   E
These boots are made for walkin'
    G                        E
And that's just what they'll do,
G                       E                        E
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin',
    E7
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned, ha!

I just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah
    E7
And what he knows you ain't had time to learn
 
 
 
      G                   E
These boots are made for walkin'
    G                        E
And that's just what they'll do,
G                       E                         E
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
