Open or Capo I*

[G] [C][G][C][G][D][G]

It's a [G]lesson too [C]late for the [G]learnin',
[C]made of [G]sand[D], made of [G]sand
In the wink of an [C]eye my soul is [G]turnin',
[C]in your [G]hand[D], in your [G]hand.

Are you [D]going away with no [C]word of fare[G]well,
will there [C]be not a [G]trace left be[D]hind?[D7]
Well, I [G]could have loved you [C]better,
didn't [G]mean to be unkind;
you [D]know that was the [D7]last thing on my [G]mind.

You've got [G]reasons a-[C]plenty for [G]goin',
[C]this I [G]know[D], this I [G]know.
For the weeds have been [C]steadily [G]growin',
[C]please don't [G]go,[D] please don't [G]go.

Are you [D]going away with no [C]word of fare[G]well,
will there [C]be not a [G]trace left be[D]hind?[D7]
Well, I [G]could have loved you [C]better,
didn't [G]mean to be unkind;
you [D]know that was the [D7]last thing on my [G]mind.

As we walk on, my [C]thoughts keep [G]tumblin',
[C]round and [G]round[D], round and [G]round
Underneath our feet the [C]subways [G]rumblin',
[C]under[G]ground[D], under[G]ground

Are you [D]going away with no [C]word of fare[G]well,
will there [C]be not a [G]trace left be[D]hind?[D7]
Well, I [G]could have loved you [C]better,
didn't [G]mean to be unkind;
you [D]know that was the [D7]last thing on my [G]mind.

As I lie in my [C]bed in the [G]mornin',
[C]without [G]you[D], without [G]you.
Every song in my [C]breast lies a [G]bornin',
[C]without [G]you[D], without [G]you.

Are you [D]going away with no [C]word of fare[G]well,
will there [C]be not a [G]trace left be[D]hind?[D7]
Well, I [G]could have loved you [C]better,
didn't [G]mean to be unkind;
you [D]know that was the [D7]last thing on my [G]mind.
