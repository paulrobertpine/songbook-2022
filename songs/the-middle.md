[D]Hey, don't write yourself off y[A]et.
It's only in your head you f[G]eel left out[A] or looked down [D]on.
Just try your b[D]est, try everything you c[A]an.
And don't you worry what they t[G]ell themselves     [A]  when you're aw[D]ay.

It just t[D]akes some time, little girl you're in the middle o[A]f the ride everything,
Everything will [G]be just fine, everything, everything will [D]be all right (all right)

[D]Hey, you know they're all the s[A]ame.
You know you're doing better [G]on your own,[A] so don't buy i[D]n.
Live right n[D]ow.       Yeah, just be yours[A]elf.
It doesn't matter if it's go[G]od enough     [A]  for someone [D]else.

It just t[D]akes some time, little girl you're in the middle o[A]f the ride everything,
Everything will [G]be just fine, everything, everything will [D]be all right (all right)

[D]Hey, don't write yourself off y[A]et.
It's only in your head you f[G]eel left out   [A]   or looked down[D]on.
Just do your b[D]est, do everything you c[A]an.
And don't you worry what the b[G]itter hearts    [A] are gonna [D]say.

It just t[D]akes some time, little girl you're in the middle o[A]f the ride everything,
Everything will [G]be just fine, everything, everything will [D]be all right (all right)
It just t[D]akes some time, little girl you're in the middle o[A]f the ride everything,
Everything will [G]be just fine, everything, everything will [D]be all right (all right)
