Intro: D A Em G

When people [D]go,
when people [A]leave,
make some people [Em]cry,
make some people [G]drink.

When people [D]go,
when people [A]leave,
it's the sad[Em]dest thing.[G]

When people [D]go,
is it like they're [A]asleep?
lost to the [Em]world,
in the longest [G]dream.

Like when boats at [D]sea,
never come [A]back,
is it li[Em]ke that?[G]

I t[A]hink it's going to be,
another [Em]long night,
i t[A]hink it's going to be,
another [Em]long ride.

When people [D]go,
when people [A]leave,
make some people [Em]cry,
make some people [G]drink.

When people [D]go,
when people [A]leave,
it's the sad[Em]dest thing.[G]

[A Em G D]
[A]Dizzy in the head,
[Em]broke in the heart,
[G]there's no business,
[D]it's all art.

Until it's[A]far behind,
and it[Em]all comes back,
[G]when people go it's so [D]sad, so [A]sad, so [Em]sad,
so [D]sad, so [A]sad, so [Em]sad.

[D A Em]
And good[D]night,
and go [A]home,
and [Em]there is n[G]othing more to [D]see,
just a [A]song,
in a [Em]box,
some [G]need to cry,
and [D]please,
find a [A]friend,
have a [Em]drink,
and [G]go home,
taking [D]two,
empty [A]hearts,
go to [Em]bed and,
go to [G]bed and.

Well good[D]night,
go [A]home,
[Em]there is [G]nothing more to [D]see,
my [A]friend,
have a [Em]drink,
go to [G]bed,
and [D]tell them, [A]how
that you [Em]need them,
[G]hold them hold them [D]tight,[A][Em][G]
