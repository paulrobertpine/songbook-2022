[A]Down in the[E] valley, [A]the first of May[E]
[F#m]Gatherin' f[C#m]lowers, both [A]fresh and gay[E]
[A]Gatherin' flow[E]ers, both[A] red and blue[E]
I li[F#m]ttle thought of [C#m]what, what [A]love could do[E]

Don'[A]t yooooou[E][A][E]
Break my h[F#m]eart[C#m][A][E]
Don'[A]t yooooou[E][A][E]
Break my h[F#m]eart[C#m][A][E]

[A]I put my [E]hand in, [A]into the bush[E]
[F#m]Findin' the [C#m]sweetest, sweetest [A]rose to pull[E]
[A]I pricked my [E]finger, deep [A]to the line[E]
And [F#m]left the sweetest ro[C#m]se, sweetest [A]rose behind[E]

Don'[A]t yooooou[E][A][E]
Break my h[F#m]eart[C#m][A][E]
Don'[A]t yooooou[E][A][E]
Break my h[F#m]eart[C#m][Asus2][E]

|A        |E     |A        |E  |
|F#m      |C#m   |A        |E  |
|A        |E     |A        |E  |
|F#m      |C#m   |A        |E  |

[A]Saw a ship s[E]ailin', on the [A]big blue sea[E]
[F#m]She sailed as [C#m]deep as, deep as [A]she could be[E]
[A]But not so [E]deep in, in [A]love as I am[E]
I [F#m]care not whether [C#m]I,    I [A]sink or swim[E]

Don'[A]t yooooou[E][A][E]
Break my h[F#m]eart[C#m][A][E]
Don'[A]t yooooou[E][A][E]
Break my h[F#m]eart[C#m][A][E]

Don'[A]t yooooou[E][A][E]
Break my h[F#m]eart[C#m][A][E]
Don'[A]t yooooou[E][A][E]
break my h[F#m]eart[C#m][A][E]

[A]Thousands and t[E]housands, all [A]on this Earth[E]
