I was [G]thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he [G7]died
I was [G]thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he [G7]died
Just a [G]country boy that combed his hair
And [C]put on a shirt his mother made and [G]went on the air
And he [Em]shook it like a chorus [G]girl
And he [Em]shook it like a Harlem [G]queen
He [Em]shook it like a midnight [G]rambler, baby
Like you [C]never seen
Like you never [G]seen, never [G7]seen

I was [G]thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he [G7]died
I was [G]thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he [G7]died
How he [G]took it all out of black and white
[C]Grabbed his wand in the other hand and he [G]held on tight
And he [Em]shook it like a hurri-[G]cane
He [Em]shook it like to make it [G]break
And he [Em]shook it like a holy [G]roller, baby
With his [C]soul at stake
With his soul at [G]stake, soul at [G7]stake

I was [G]thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he [G7]died
I was [G]thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he [G7]died
He was [G]all alone in a long decline
[C]Thinking how happy John Henry was that he [G]fell down and died
When he [Em]shook it and he rang like [G]silver
He [Em]shook it and he shine like [G]gold
He [Em]shook it and he beat that [G]steam drill, baby
Well [C]bless my soul, Well bless my [G]soul
He [EM]shook it and he beat that [G]steam drill, baby
Well [C]bless my soul, what's wrong with me?

I was [G]thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he [G7]died
I was [G]thinking that night about Elvis
Day that he died, day that he [G7]died
Just a [G]country boy that combed his hair
And [C]put on a shirt his mother made and [G]went on the air
And he [Em]shook it like a chorus [G]girl
And he [Em]shook it like a Harlem [G]queen
He [Em]shook it like a midnight [G]rambler, baby
Like you [C]never seen
Like you never [G]seen, never [G7]seen
