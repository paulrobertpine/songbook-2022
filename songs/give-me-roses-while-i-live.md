[G]Wonderful things of folks are said
[D7]When they have passed [G]away
[G]Roses adorn the narrow bed
[D7]Over the sleeping [G]clay

(chorus)
[C]Give me the roses [G]while I live
[G]Trying to cheer me [D7]on
[G]Useless are flowers that you give
[D7]After the soul has [G]gone

(play chorus instrumental after each chorus)

[G]Let us not wait to do good deeds
[D7]Till they have passed a-[G]way
[G]Now is the time to sow good seeds
[D7]While here on earth we [G]stay

(chorus)

[G]Kind words are useless when folks lie
[D7]Cold in a narrow [G]bed
[G]Don't wait till death to speak kind words
[D7]Now should the words be [G]said

(chorus x2)
