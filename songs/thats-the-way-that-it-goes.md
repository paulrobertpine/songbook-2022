Em
Becky Johnson bought the farm
Em
Put a needle in her arm
           B7
That's the way that it goes 
           Em
That's the way
 
Em
And her brother laid her down
Em
In the cold Kentucky ground
           B7
That's the way that it goes
           Em
That's the way
 
           G           Em
That's the way that it goes
     C                         G         D
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
           G           Em
That's the way that it ends
             C              B7               Em
Though there was a time when she and I were friends
 
Em
Well, Miranda ran away
Em
Took her cat and left LA
           B7
That's the way that it goes 
           Em
That's the way
 
Em
She was busted, broke and flat
Em
Had to sell that pussy cat
           B7
That's the way that it goes 
           Em
That's the way
 
           G           Em
That's the way that it goes
     C                         G         D
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
           G           Em
That's the way that it ends
             C              B7               Em
Though there was a time when he and I were friends
 
Em
See the brightest ones of all
Em
Early in October fall
           B7
That's the way that it goes 
           Em
That's the way
 
Em
While the dark ones go to bed
Em
With good whiskey in their head
           B7
That's the way that it goes 
           Em
That's the way
 
Em
Now Billy Joe's back in the tank
Em
You tell Musso, I'll tell Frank
           B7
That's the way that it goes 
           Em
That's the way
 
Em
Did he throw her down a well?
Em
Did she leave him for that swell?
           B7
That's the way that it goes 
           Em
That's the way
 
           G           Em
That's the way that it goes
     C                         G         D
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
           G           Em
That's the way that it ends
             C              B7               Em
Though there was a time when all of us were friends
 
Em
When you lay me down to rest
Em
Leave a pistol in my vest
           B7
That's the way that it goes 
           Em
That's the way
 
Em
Do you miss my gentle touch?
Em
Did I hurt you very much?
           B7
That's the way that it goes 
           Em
That's the way
 
           G           Em
That's the way that it goes
     C                         G         D
Everybody's buying little baby clothes
           G           Em

Though there was a time when you and I were friends
