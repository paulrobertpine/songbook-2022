[G]Desp[G7]erado, why don't[C] you come to y[Cm]our senses?
You been [G]out [G/F]ridin' f[Em]ences for [A7]so long [D7]now.
Oh, you're a [G]hard one,[G7]
But I know that [C]you've got your r[Cm]easons.
These [G]things that[G/F#] are ple[Em]asin' you,
Can [A7]hurt you [D7]somehow.[G][D/F#]

Don't you [Em]draw the queen of [Bm]diamonds, boy,
She'll [C]beat you if she's [G]able.[G/F#]
Know the [Em]queen of hearts is al[C]ways your best [G]bet.[D/F#]
Now it [Em]seems to me, some [Bm]fine things,
Have been [C]laid upon your [G]table.
But you [A7]only want the things that you can't [Dsus4]get.[D]

Despe[G]rado[G7], oh, you ain't [C]gettin' no you[Cm]nger:
Your pain[G] and[G/F#] your h[Em]unger, th[A7]ey're dri[D7]vin' you home.
And freedo[G]m, oh fre[G7]edom,
Well, that's jus[C]t some people tal[Cm]kin'
Your p[G]rison [G/F#]is walki[Em]ng,
Thro[A7]ugh this [D7]world all[G] alo[D/F#]ne.

And don't [Em]your feet get cold[Bm]in the winter time?
The sky[C] won't snow, the s[G]un wo[G/F#]n't shine
It's hard[Em] to tell the nig[C]ht time from th[G]e day[D/F#]
You're [Em]loosin' all your h[Bm]ighs and lows
Ain't it f[C]unny how the fe[G]eling,
Goes awa[A7]y?[Dsus4] [D]

Despe[G]rado[G7], why don't you [C]come to your s[Cm]enses?
Come [G]down from [G/F#]your fen[Em]ces, and o[A7]pen the g[D7]ate
It may be [G]rainin'[G7], but there's a [C]rainbow ab[Cm]ove you,
You better [G]let some[G/F#]body lo[Em]ve you,
You better [C]let some[G/B]body [A7]love you,
You better [G]let some[B7]body [Em]love you,
[C]        [D7]        [G]
Before it's too late.
