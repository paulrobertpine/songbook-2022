[Verse 1]
 
Am                              F    C
When the leader of the bad guys sang
                             Dm   Am
Something soft and soaked in pain
                                 F   C
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway
Am                             F    C
He must've forgot to close his door
                               Dm     Am
As he cranked out those dismal chords
                            F     C
And his four walls declared him insane
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
  Em
I found my way
      B
Right time wrong place
     Dm       G
As I pled my case
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           F         C
You're the judge, oh no
       G   Am
Set me free
           F         C
You're the judge, oh no
       G   Am
Set me free
  F              G
I know my soul's freezing
       C            Am
Hell's hot for good reason
   F
So please, take me
 
Am              F  C
    Na Na Na Na Oh Oh
                Dm Am
    Na Na Na Na Oh Oh
                F  C
    Na Na Na Na Oh Oh
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am
Three lights are lit
                     F
But the fourth one's out
      C
I can tell cause it's a bit darker
                      Dm
Than the last night's bout
     Am
I forgot about the drought
                       F
Of light bulbs in this house
          C
So I head out
                                Dm
Down a route I think is heading south
            Am
But I'm not good with directions
                     F
And I hide behind my mouth
      C
I'm a pro at imperfections
                             Dm
And I'm best friends with my doubt
    Am
And now that my mind's out
                            F
And now I hear it clear and loud
               C
I'm thinking, 'Wow
 
I probably should've stayed inside my house.'
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
  Em
I found my way
      B
Right time wrong place
     Dm       G
As I pled my case
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           F         C
You're the judge, oh no
       G   Am
Set me free
           F         C
You're the judge, oh no
       G   Am
Set me free
  F              G
I know my soul's freezing
       C            Am
Hell's hot for good reason
   F
So please
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am                      F    C
   I don't know if this song
                    Dm    Am
Is a surrender or a revel
                     F   C
I don't know if this one
                   Dm
Is about me or the devil
 
Am                      F    C
   I don't know if this song
                    Dm    Am
Is a surrender or a revel
                     F   C
I don't know if this one
                   Dm    Am
Is about me or the devil
 
 
[Chorus]
 
           F         C
You're the judge, oh no
       G        Am
Set me free, oh no
           F         C
You're the judge, oh no
       G        Am
Set me free, oh no
  F              G
I know my soul's freezing
       C            Am
Hell's hot for good reason
   F
So please
