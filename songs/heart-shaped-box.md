[Verse]

Am   F       D             Am   F    D  D7
 She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak, 
Am         F        D                      Am  F   D  D7
 I've been locked inside your heart shaped box for weeks. 
Am         F       D              Am  F   D  D7
 I've been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap, 
Am      F       D               Am   F        D  D7
 I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black... 


[Chorus]

  Am    F
    Hey, wait,  
  D    
    I got a new complaint,      
  Am   F       D       
    Forever in debt to your priceless advice,   
  Am    F
    Hey, wait,

    I got a new complaint,
  Am   F       D

[Verse]

Am   F       D             Am   F    D  D7
Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet. 
Am         F        D                      Am  F   D  D7
Cut myself on angel hair and baby's breath. 
Am         F       D              Am  F   D  D7
Broken hymen of your highness, I'm left black, 
Am      F       D               Am   F        D  D7
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back...
