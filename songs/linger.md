If you, if you could return
           A6
Don't let it burn, don't let it fade
                       C
I'm sure I'm not being rude
But it's just your attitude
                G
It's tearing me apart
It's ruining everything

      D
And I swore, I swore I would be true
             A6
And honey so did you
                          C
So why were you holding her hand
Is that the way we stand
                       G
Were you lying all the time
Was it just a game to you

              D
But I'm in so deep
                  A6
You know I'm such a fool for you
                             C
You got me wrapped around your finger
                      G
Do you have to let it linger
Do you have to, do you have to
                      D
do you have to let it linger
                  A6
Oh, I thought the world of you
        C
I thought nothing could go wrong
          G
But I was wrong
I was wrong

D
If you, if you could get by
            A6
Trying not to lie
                    C
Things wouldn't be so confused
And I wouldn't feel so used
                      G
But you always really knew
I just wanna be with you

              D
And I'm in so deep
                  A6
You know I'm such a fool for you
                             C
You got me wrapped around your finger
                      G
Do you have to let it linger
Do you have to. do you have to
                      D
do you have to let it linger
                  A6
You know I'm such a fool for you
                             C
You got me wrapped around your finger
                      G
Do you have to let it linger
Do you have to, do you have to
                      D
do you have to let it linger
