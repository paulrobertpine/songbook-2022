[G]Almost Heaven, [Em]West Virginia, [D]Blue Ridge Mountains, [C]Shenandoah [G]River.
[G]Life is old there,[Em] older than the trees,[D] younger than the mountains, [C]blowin like [G]a breeze.

Chorus
[G]Country Roads, take [D7]me home, to the [Em]place I [C]belong
[G]West Virginia, [D]mountain mama, take me [C]home, country [G]roads.

Verse 2
[G] All my memories [Em]gather round her, [D]miner's lady, [C]stranger to blue [G]water.
[G]Dark and dusty, [Em]painted on the sky,[D] misty taste of moonshine, [C]teardrop in my [G]eye.

Chorus
[G]Country Roads, take [D7]me home, to the [Em]place I [C]belong
[G]West Virginia, [D]mountain mama, take me [C]home, country [G]roads.

Bridge                 
[Em]I hear her [D7/F]voice in the [G]morning hours she calls me
[C]the radio [G]reminds me of my [D]home far away.
And [Em]driving down the [F]road I get a [C]feeling that I [G]should have been home
[D]yesterday, [D7]yesterday.

Chorus x2
[G]Country Roads, take [D7]me home, to the [Em]place I [C]belong
[G]West Virginia, [D]mountain mama, take me [C]home, country [G]roads.

Outro
Take me [D]home, country [G]roads.
Take me [D]home, country [G]roads.
