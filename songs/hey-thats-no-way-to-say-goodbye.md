I [A]loved you in the morning, our kisses deep and warm,

your [F#m]hair upon the pillow like a sleepy golden storm,

yes, [D]many loved before us, I know that we are not new,

in [A]city and in forest they smiled like me and you,

but [F#m]now it's come to distances and both of us must try,

your [D]eyes are soft with sorrow,

[E]Hey, that's no way to say good [A]by[E]e.



I'm not [A]looking for another as I wander in my time,

[F#m]walk me to the corner, our steps will always rhyme

[D]you know my love goes with you as your love stays with me,

it's [A]just the way it changes, like the shoreline and the sea,

but [F#m]let's not talk of love or chains and things we can't untie,

your [D]eyes are soft with sorrow,

[E]Hey, that's no way to say good [A]by[E]e.
