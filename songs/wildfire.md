[Verse 1]
B[A]rave men fall with a [G]battle cry
[D]Tears fill the eyes of their loved ones and their brothers in [A]arms
So it [G]went, for Joseph [D]Warren

It [A]should have been different, it [G]could have been easy
His [D]rank could have saved him, but a country unborn needs [A]bravery
And it [G]spread like w[D]ildfire

[Chorus]
[A]   W[G]ildf[D]ire
[A]   W[G]ildf[D]ire

[Verse 2]
From the a[A]shes grew sweet l[G]iberty
Like the s[D]eeds of the pines when the forest burns
They o[A]pen up, g[G]row and burn a[D]gain

It s[A]hould have been different, it c[G]ould have been easy
But t[D]oo much money rolled in to ever end s[A]lavery
The cry for [G]war spread like w[D]ildfire

[Chorus]
[A]   W[G]ildf[D]ire
[A]   W[G]ildf[D]ire

[Instrumental]
[A] [G][D][(x2)]

[Verse 3]
C[A]ivil war came, c[G]ivil war went
[D]Brother fought brother, the south was spent
But its t[A]rue demise was h[G]atred, passed down t[D]hrough the years

It s[A]hould have been different, it c[G]ould have been easy
But p[D]ride has a way of holding too firm to hi[A]story
And it b[G]urns like wi[D]ldfire

[Chorus]
[A]   W[G]ildf[D]ire
[A]   W[G]ildf[D]ire

[Instrumental]
[A] [G][D][(x2)]

[Verse 4]
[A]  I was born a s[G]outhern son
In a s[D]mall southern town where the rebels run wild
[A] They beat their chest and they s[G]wear: we're gonna ris[D]e again

It s[A]hould have been different, it c[G]ould have been easy
The [D]day that old Warren died, hate should have gone with it[A]
But here we [G]are, caught in the wi[D]ldfire

[Chorus]
[A]   W[G]ildf[D]ire
[A]   W[G]ildf[D]ire
