[D]Washed  [Am]a--[C]shore.[G]....[D]Washed [Am] a--[C]shore..[G]..


[D]I'd like to [Am]live beneath the [C]dirt[G]
[D]A tiny space to [Am]move and breathe is [C]all that I would [G]ever need

[D]I wanna [Am]live beneath the [C]dirt[G]
[D]Where I'd be free from [Am]push and shove [C]like all those swarming [G]up above
[Em]Beneath their [C]heels I'll spend my [D]time....
                                 (Shout your name…)

[D]Shout your name in[Am]to the wind......
[C]I'll wiggle in the [G]earth and dew
[D]Shout your name in[Am]to the wind.......
[C]And sometimes I will [G]think of you
[D]Shout your name in[Am]to the wind.....
[C]And if you ever [G]think of me, kneel [D]down and kiss the [Am]earth
[C]and show me what this [G]thought is worth
[Em]I'll never hear your [C]voice again[D]
