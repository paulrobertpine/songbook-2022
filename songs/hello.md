[Intro]
[Em] [G/D][D][C]

[Verse]
Hel[Em]lo,[G/D] it's[D] m[C]e.
I was w[Em]ondering if[G/D] after all these [D]years you'd like t[C]o meet, to [Em]go o[G/D]ver ev[D]eryth[C]ing
They say that t[Em]ime's supposed [G/D]to heal you, but I ain't[D] done much[C]healing.
He[Em]llo[G/D], can you [D]hear [C]me?
I'm in [Em]California[G/D] dreaming about [D]who we use[C]d to be when we wer[Em]e youn[G/D]ger a[D]nd f[C]ree.
I've forg[Em]otten how [G/D]it felt before the [D]world fell at[C]our feet.

[Pre-Chorus]
There's such a d[Em]ifference[D] bet[Bm]ween[C]us
and a m[Em]illi[D]on [C]miles.

[Chorus]
[Em]Hello from t[C]he other s[G/D]ide,[D]
I [Em]must've called [C]a thousand [G/D]times[D]to tell you
[Em]I'm s[C]orry, for everyt[G/D]hing that I've [D]done,
But when I c[Em]all you n[C]ever [G/D]seem to be[D]home.
[Em]Hello from [C]the out[G/D]side,[D]
At [Em]least I can s[C]ay that I've t[G/D]ried[D]to tell you
[Em]I'm so[C]rry, for b[G/D]reaking your[D]heart
But it don't matt[Em]er, it cl[C]early doesn't [G/D]tear you [D]apart anymore.

[Instrumental]
[Em] [G/D][D][C]

[Verse]
Hel[Em]lo,[G/D] how [D]are you[C]?
It's so [Em]typical o[G/D]f me to talk a[D]bout myself, [C]I'm sorry
I h[Em]ope[G/D] that you're [D]well[C]
Did you [Em]ever make i[G/D]t out of that town where [D]nothing [C]ever happened?

[Pre-Chorus]
It's no s[Em]ecr[D]et that the [Bm]both of[C]us
are r[Em]unning o[D]ut of t[C]ime.

[Chorus]
So, [Em]hello from t[C]he other s[G/D]ide,[D]
I [Em]must've called [C]a thousand [G/D]times[D]to tell you
[Em]I'm s[C]orry, for everyt[G/D]hing that I've[D]done,
But when I c[Em]all you n[C]ever [G/D]seem to be[D]home.
[Em]Hello from [C]the out[G/D]side,[D]
At [Em]least I can s[C]ay that I've t[G/D]ried[D]to tell you
[Em]I'm so[C]rry, for b[G/D]reaking your[D]heart
But it don't matt[Em]er, it cl[C]early doesn't [G/D]tear you [D]apart anymore.
Any[Em]more oh    [C]     o[D]oooohh[G/D]
Any[Em]more oh    [C]     o[D]oooohh[G/D]
Any[Em]more oh    [C]     o[D]oooohh[G/D]
Any[Em]more ohhhh   [C]     any[D]more

[Chorus]
So, [Em]hello from t[C]he other s[G/D]ide,[D]
I [Em]must've called [C]a thousand [G/D]times[D]to tell you
[Em]I'm s[C]orry, for everyt[G/D]hing that I've[D]done,
But when I c[Em]all you n[C]ever [G/D]seem to be[D]home.
[Em]Hello from [C]the out[G/D]side,[D]
At [Em]least I can s[C]ay that I've t[G/D]ried[D]to tell you
