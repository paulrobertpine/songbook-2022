[C]it's perfectly [Am]suited
this[G]uniform grey
there [C]are no [Am]bearings
[G]to the day
I came down from the air
and I'll leave by boat

I'm down with your rainy town
out on the spit
with the biggest port around
my friend is on the way
he's bringing my coat

oh [F]you don't [G]do, what I [Am]want you to
but I [F]haven't [G]been
through [C]what [Em]you've been through
and [F]we could [G]use that
[Am]as an excuse
if [F]that's what you choose
if [G]that's what you choose

well it was kinda hard
to pull away
he said "Buck up baby,it's okay,
The sunlight on the floor will always fall."

and I meant to write it on the plane
high above my earthly pain
but I slept right through the flight
and that was all

oh [F]you don't [G]do, what I [Am]want you to
but I [F]haven't [G]been
through [C]what [Em]you've been through
and [F]we could [G]use that
[Am]as an excuse
if [F]that's what you choose
if [G]that's what you choose
