Am7                     Dm
You never give me your money
G                     C     C/B
You only give me your funny paper

[Bridge]
 
C            E7
Out of college, money spent
Am            C7
See no future, pay no rent
F               G                C
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
C         E7
Any jobber got the sack
Am             C7
Monday morning, turning back
F            G                C
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
     Bb                    F           C
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Bb                     F           C
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go, nowhere to go
 
Bb  F  C

[Verse]
 
A7        B7
One sweet dream
C                    E7               A7
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
   D7        G7
Soon we'll be away from here
   D7               G7              A
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
          B7         C    G/B    A
One sweet dream came true... today
     C    G/B    A
Came true... today
     C    G/B    A
Came true... today...yes it did

All good children go to Heaven.
