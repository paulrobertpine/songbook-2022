Saw a [G]man[C]
[G]standing at the [C]crossroads[G]
[Am7]with a tear on his [B]face
It was a [G]man[C]
[G]waiting for inve[C]ntion[G]
[Am7]in a moment of [B]grace

[G]Gonna give that man a road[Gsus4]
he can [G]walk on
[Gsus4]give that a man [G]road to [F]Jes[C]us
[G]Gonna give that man a road[Gsus4]
he can [G]walk on
[Gsus4]give that a man [G]road to [F]Jes[Am7]us

Was a [G]man[C]
[G]down in the dark[C]ened valley[G]
[Am7]with a chain on his [B]hand
yet it was a [G]man[C]
[G]made to walk in [C]the sunshine[G]
[Am7]be the light of the [B]land

[G]Gonna give that man a road[Gsus4]
he can [G]walk on
[Gsus4]give that a man [G]road to [F]Jes[C]us
[G]Gonna give that man a road[Gsus4]
he can [G]walk on
[Gsus4]give that a man [G]road to [F]Jes[Am7]us

[G]     [C]
[G]     [C]
[G]     [Am7]
[B]     [B]

Gonna [G]push[C]
[G]onward in my [C]journey[G]
[Am7]to the promised [B]land
and I'm going to [G]shout[C]
[G]glory to King [C]Jesus[G]
[Am7]upon the rocks and the [B]sand

[G]Gonna give that man a road[Gsus4]
he can [G]walk on
[Gsus4]give that a man [G]road to [F]Jes[C]us
[G]Gonna give that man a road[Gsus4]
he can [G]walk on
[Gsus4]give that a man [G]road to [F]Jes[Am7]us
