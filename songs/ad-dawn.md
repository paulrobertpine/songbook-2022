Capo I
Opens with drums...strum just a C chord.

[C]At dawn they ride a[F]gain, they'll h[C]aul you out to the s[F]treets.
They'll [G]burn your papers and your e[F]mpty trash cans,
[G]Beat this thought into your [F]head, singin [G]over and over a[F]gain:
[C]"all your life is [F]obscene!"
[C]"forget the papers, forget your musical d[F]reams!"
[G]but that's when my knife [F]rises,
[G]their life ends and my li[F]fe starts [C]again!
