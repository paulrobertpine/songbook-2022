[D]Outside there's a [A]box car waiting
[Em]Outside the [G]family stew
[D]Out by the [A]fire breathing
[Em]Outside we [G]wait 'til face turns blue
[D]I know the [A]nervous walking
[Em]I know the [G]dirty beard hangs
[D]Out by the [A]box car waiting
[Em]Take me away to [G]nowhere plains

[Bm]There is a wait so [G]long (so long, so long)
[A]You'll never wait so [D]long
[G][A]Here comes your [D]man
[G][A]Here comes your [D]man
[G][A]Here comes your man

| [D]/ / / / | [A]/ / / / | [Em]/ / / / | [G]/ / / / |

[D]Big shake on the [A]box car moving
[Em]Big shake to the [G]land that's falling down
[D]Is a wind makes a [A]palm stop blowing
A [Em]big, big stone fall and [G]break my crown

[Bm]There is a wait so [G]long (so long, so long)
[A]You'll never wait so [D]long
[G][A]Here comes your [D]man
[G][A]Here comes your [D]man
[G][A]Here comes your [D]maaaaaan
[G][A]Here comes your man
