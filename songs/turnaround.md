 [C]Bits and [Em]pieces, [Am]you offered [Am/G]
 [F]Of your life I [C]didn't think
They [G]meant a lot
Or said much for [C]you

[C]And all the [Em]chances to [Am]follow [Am/G]
[F]Didn't make a [C]lot of sense
When [G]stacked against
The [Em]choices you [Am]made [Am/G]

CHORUS:
 [F]For yours [G]was the [C]open road.
The [F]bitter song, the [G]heavy load
That I couldn't [C]share
Though the [Em]offer was [Am]there. [Am/G]
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around

[C]Now it's [Em]not like [Am]you made [Am/G]out
[F]To hang around, [C] Although you know
[G]I made some sounds
To show that I cared [C]

[C]And when it [Em]looked like you [Am]heard the call [Am/G]
[F]I didn't say a [C]lot
Although I [G]could have said
Much [Em]more had I [Am]dared [Am/G]

CHORUS:
 [F]For [G]yours was the [C]open road.
[F]The bitter song, the [G]heavy load
That I couldn't [C]share
Though the [Em]offer was [Am]there. [Am/G]
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around
 
[C] And [Em]if I had [Am]followed [Am/G] 
A [F]little ways
[C]Because were friends
You [G]would have made me
Welcome out [C]there

[C]But we [Em]both know it's [Am]just as well [Am/G]
Cause [F]some can go, but
[C]Some are meant
To [G]stay behind
And it's [Em] always that [Am]way [Am/G]

CHORUS 2:
 [F]For [G]yours was the [C]open road.
[F]The bitter song, the [G]heavy load
That I couldn't [C]share
Though the [Em]offer's still [Am]there. [Am/G]
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around
 
 [F]For [G]yours was the [C]open road.
[F]The bitter song, the [G]heavy load
That I couldn't [C]share
Though the [Em]offer's still [Am]there. [Am/G]
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around

 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around
 [F]Every [G]time you [C]turned around
