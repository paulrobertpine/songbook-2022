Verse 1
 
D
She's got a smile that it seems to me
  C
Reminds me of childhood memories
       G
Where everything
                                D
Was as fresh as a bright blue sky
D
Now and then when I see her face
    C
She takes me away to that special place
         G
And if I stared too long
                              D
I'd probably break down and cry
 
 
Chorus
 
A               C              D
Whoa oh, sweet child o' mine
A               C              D
Whoa, oh, oh, oh sweet love o' mine

Verse 2
 
D
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
   C
As if they thought of rain
    G
I'd hate to look into those eyes
    D
And see an ounce of pain
    D
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
      C
Where as a child I'd hide
    G
And pray for the thunder and rain
     D
To quietly pass me by
 
 
Chorus
 
A        C              D
Whoa oh, oh, sweet child o' mine
A              C                D
Whoa, oh, oh, oh sweet love o' mine

Whoa oh, sweet child o' mine
A               C              D
Whoa, oh, oh, oh sweet love o' mine
A               C              D
Whoa oh, oh, oh sweet child o' mine
A               C         D
Ooooooooh sweet love o' mine
