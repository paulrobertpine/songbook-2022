[G]
Whe[C]re are you going I[F] don't m[G]ind
I've kil[C]led my world and I've ki[F]lled my t[G]ime
So wh[C]ere do I go w[F]hat do I s[G]ee
I see ma[C]ny people coming af[F]ter [G]me
So wh[C]ere are you going to [F]I don't m[E]ind
If I li[Am]ve too lo[Am/G]ng I'm afra[F]id I'll d[C]ie
So [F]I will follow you where[C]ver you g[E]o
If your off[Am]ered h[Am/G]and is still o[F]pen to [C]me

S[E]trangers [E7]on this r[Am]oad we are o[F]n
We[C] are not t[G]wo; we are o[C]ne[C/B][F][C][G]

S[C]o you've been where I'[F]ve just c[G]ome
Fr[C]om the land that brings lo[F]sers [G]on
S[C]o we will share this ro[F]ad we wa[G]lk
And m[C]ind our mouths and b[F]eware our t[G]alk
Till pe[C]ace we find tell you wh[F]at I'll d[E]o
All the th[Am]ings I o[Am/G]wn I will sha[F]re with y[C]ou
And if I fe[F]el tomorrow like I f[C]eel t[E]oday
We'll ta[Am]ke what we w[Am/G]ant and give the r[F]est aw[C]ay

S[E]trangers [E7]on this r[Am]oad we are o[F]n
We[C] are not t[G]wo; we are o[C]ne[C/B][F][C][G]

H[C]oly man and h[F]oly pri[G]est
This lo[C]ve of life makes me we[F]ak in my kn[G]ees
And wh[C]en we get there ma[F]ke your pl[G]ay
Cos so[C]on I feel you're gonna c[F]arry us a[G]way
In a prom[C]ised lie you ma[F]de us bel[E]ieve
For m[Am]any m[Am/G]en there is s[F]o much gr[C]ief
And my mi[F]nd is proud but it ac[C]hes with r[E]age
And if I l[Am]ive too l[Am/G]ong I'm afr[F]aid I'll d[C]ie

S[E]trangers [E7]on this r[Am]oad we are o[F]n
We[C] are not t[G]wo; we are o[C]ne [C/B][F][C][G]

S[E]trangers [E7]on this r[Am]oad we are o[F]n
