      C                                C7        F
I was dancing with my darlin', to the Tennessee Waltz
        C                        G7
When an old friend I happened to see
       C
I introduced her to my loved one,
    C7              F
And while they were waltzing,
   C               G7              C
my friend stole my sweetheart from me.
 
    C           E7            F         C
I remember that night and the Tennessee Waltz,
                               G7
Now I know just how much I have lost
       C                           C7              F
Yes, I lost my little darlin', the night they were playing,
     C         G7        C
that beautiful Tennessee Waltz.

Yes I remember that night and the Tennessee Waltz,
                               G7
only you know  how much I have lost
       C                           C7              F
Yes, I lost my little darlin', the night they were playing,
     C         G7        C
that beautiful Tennessee Waltz.
               G7        C
That beautiful Tennessee Waltz
