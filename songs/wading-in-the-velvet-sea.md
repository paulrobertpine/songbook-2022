[G]I've been Wading in the Velvet Sea
[D]I've been Wading in the Velvet Sea
[Em]I've been Wading in the Velvet Sea
[C]I've been Wading in the
[D]I've been Wading in the

[G]Took a moment from my day[D]
wrapped it up in things you s[Em]ay
mailed it off to your add[C]ress
you will get i[D]t pretty soon, unle[G]ss
the packaging begins to b[D]reak
and all the points I try to [Em]make
tossed my thoughts into a [C]bin
my time leaks ou[D]t, my life leaks i[G]n
You won"t find moments in a bo[D]x
and someone else will set your cloc[Em]ks
took a moment from my da[C]y
and wrapped it[D] up in things you s[G]ay
(No Chords)
And mailed it off to you...

[Bm] -> [C]

[Bm] -> [C]

[Bm] -> [C]

(Go right back into verse)

[D]You won"t find moments in a [Am]box
And someone else will set your clo[C]cks
I took a m[D]oment from my d[G]ay
