[G][D][Em][C][G][D][G][D]

[G]The lamp is [D]burnin' low u[Em]pon my table [C]top,
[G]The snow is [D]softly [G]fallin[D]g
[G]The air is [D]still within the [Em]silence of my [C]room,
[G]I hear your [D]voice softly [G]calling

If I could [D]only [C]have you [D]near,
[Bm]To breathe a [Em]sigh [Am]or [D]two
[G]I would be [D]happy just to [Em]hold the hands I [C]love,
U[G]pon this [D]winter night with [G]you

[G][D][Em][C][G][D][G][D]

[G]The smoke is [D]rising in the [Em]shadows over[C]head,
[G]My glass is [D]almost [G]empt[D]y
[G]I read a[D]gain between the [Em]lines upon each [C]page,
[G]The words of [D]love you [G]sent me

[CHORUS]

If I could [D]know with[C]in my [D]heart,
[Bm]That you were [Em]lone[Am]ly  [D]too
[G]I would be [D]happy just to [Em]hold the hands I [C]love,
U[G]pon this [D]winter night with [G]you

[G][D][Em][C][G][D][G][D]

[G]The fire is [D]dying now, my [Em]lamp is growing [C]dim,
[G]The shades of [D]night are [G]lifti[D]n'
[G]The morning [D]light steals a[Em]cross my window[C]pane,
[G]Where webs of [D]snow are [G]driftin'

If I could [D]only [C]have you [D]near,
[Bm]To breathe a [Em]sigh [Am]or [D]two
[G]I would be [D]happy just to [Em]hold the hands I [C]love,
U[G]pon this [D]winter night with [B7]you[Em],
[G]And to be [D]once again with [G]you

[G][D][Em][C][G][D][G][D]
