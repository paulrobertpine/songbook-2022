[C]  Ground control to Major [Em]Tom
[C]  Ground control to Major [Em]Tom
[Am]  Take your [Am/G]protein pills and [D/F#]put your helmet on
[C]  Ground control to Major [Em]Tom
[C]  Commencing countdown engines [Em]on
[Am]  Check ig[Am/G]nition and may [D/F#]God's love be with you

[C]This is ground control to Major T[E]om
You've really made the gr[F]ade
And the [Fm]papers want to k[C]now whose shirt you w[F]ear
Now it's [Fm]time to leave the c[C]apsule if you d[F]are
Th[C]is is Major Tom to ground contr[E]ol
I'm stepping through the d[F]oor
And I'm f[Fm]loating in a m[C]ost peculiar w[F]ay
And the s[Fm]tars look very d[C]ifferent tod[F]ay

For [Fmaj7]here am I [Em]sitting in a tin can
[Fmaj7]Far above the [Em]world
[Bb]Planet Earth is [Am]blue and there's [G]nothing I can [F]do

[C]Though I'm past one hundred thousand mi[E]les
I'm feeling very st[F]ill
And I t[Fm]hink my spaceship k[C]nows which way to g[F]o
Tell my w[Fm]ife I love her v[C]ery much she k[F]nows

[G]Ground control to [E7]Major Tom, your [Am]circuit's dead, there's [C/G]something wrong
Can you [D/F#]hear me Major Tom?
Can you [C]hear me Major Tom?
Can you [G]hear me Major Tom? Can you...

[Fmaj7]Here am I [Em]floating 'round my tin can
[Fmaj7]Far above the [Em]Moon
[Bb]Planet Earth is [Am]blue and there's [G]nothing I can [F]do
