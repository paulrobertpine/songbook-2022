Intro 
[F] [C] [G] (x2)

I[G] had a real good mot[F]her and fat[C]her
and they surely stood the t[G]est
and now are in bright gl[C]ory
and [D]sleeping [C]on [Bm]the savio-[Am]ur's bre[G]ast

They set a good exa[F]mple for m[C]e
and they taught me how to pr[G]ay
now I truly conve[C]rted
and [D]walkin[C]g on t[Bm]he narr[Am]ow wa[G]y

(solo)

I know that if I cannot meet th[F]em on h[C]igh
then how lonely I will be[G]
for what good is my journ[C]ey
if I [D]miss [C]out o[Bm]n eter[Am]nity[G]

(solo)

I[G] had a real good mot[F]her and fat[C]her
