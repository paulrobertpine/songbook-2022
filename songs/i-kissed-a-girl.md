[Verse]

Am          C            Dm
This was never the way i planned,
    F
not my intention.
Am        C              Dm  
i got so brave, drink in hand,
     F
lost my discretion.
Am            C
It's not what i'm used to,
Dm   F     
just want to try you on.
Am      C           Dm
i'm curious, for you,
       F
caught my attention.


[Chorus]

Am         C
I kissed a girl,
            Dm
and I liked it.
                 F
The taste of her cherry chapstick.
Am         C
I kissed a girl,
            Dm
Just to try it.
             F
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.
Am         C
It felt so wrong,
           Dm
It felt so right.
               F
Don't mean i'm in love tonight.

Am         C
I kissed a girl,
            Dm
And I liked it.
F
   I liked it


[Verse]

Am          C            Dm
No, I don't even know your name,
    F
It doesn't matter.
Am        C              Dm  
Your my experimental game,
     F
Just human nature.
Am            C
It's not what good girls do,
Dm   F     
Not how they should behave.
Am      C           Dm
My head gets so confused,
    F
Hard to erase.


[Chorus]

Am         C
I kissed a girl,
            Dm
and I liked it.
                 F
The taste of her cherry chapstick.
Am         C
I kissed a girl,
            Dm
Just to try it.
             F
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.

Am         C
It felt so wrong,
           Dm
It felt so right.
               F
Don't mean i'm in love tonight.

Am         C
I kissed a girl,
            Dm
And I liked it.
F
   I liked it


[Verse]

Am          C            Dm
Us girls we are so magical,
    F
Soft skin, red lips, so kissable,
Am        C              Dm  
Hard to resist, so touchable.
     F
To good to deny it.
Am            C
Ain't no big deal,
Dm   F     
Its innocent.


[Chorus]

Am         C
I kissed a girl,
            Dm
and I liked it.
                 F
The taste of her cherry chapstick.
Am         C
I kissed a girl,
            Dm
Just to try it.
             F
I hope my boyfriend don't mind it.

Am         C
It felt so wrong,
           Dm
It felt so right.
               F
Don't mean i'm in love tonight.

Am         C
I kissed a girl,
            Dm
And I liked it.
F
   I liked it
