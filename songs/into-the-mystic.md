[Intro]
C
(6 bars)
 
 
C
  We were born before the wind
C
  Also younger than the sun
G
  'Ere the bonny boat was won
                      C
As we sailed into the mystic
 
 
C
  Hark, now, hear the sailor's cry
C
  Smell the sea and feel the sky
G
  Let your soul and spirit fly
         C
Into the mystic
 
 
Em                    F
   When that foghorn blows,
        C
I will be comin' home, mmm hmm hm
Em                  F
   When the foghorn blows,
        G
I wanna hear it, I don't have to fear it
 
 
    C
And I wanna rock your gypsy soul
C
  Just like way back in the days of old
G
  And magnificently we will float
         C
Into the mystic
 
 
| C   | C   | C   | C   |
| G   | G   | C   | C   |
 
 
Em                F
   When that foghorn blows,
C
  you know I will be comin' home
Em       F
   And when that foghorn whistle blows,
G
  I gotta hear it, I don't have to fear it
 
 
    C
And I wanna rock your gypsy soul
C
  Just like way back in the days of old
G
  And together we will float
         C
Into the mystic ... Come on girl

C                    G        C
   Too late to stop now-o-ow!...
