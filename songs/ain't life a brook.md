[G] [Cmaj7][C][Cmaj7][C][Cmaj7][C][Cmaj7][G]

I watch you reading a [G]book
[G]I get to thinking [Cmaj7]our love's a polished stone
You give me a l[C]ong [Cmaj7]drawn l[C]ook
[Cmaj7]I know pretty [C]soon you're going to leav[Cmaj7]e our [G]home

And of course I[G]mind
[G]Especially when I'[Cmaj7]m thinking from my heart
But life don't c[C]lickety clack[Cmaj7] down a s[C]traight line track
[Cmaj7]You come to[C]gether and you come[Cmaj7] a  -  [G]part

You say[C] you hope I'm not the [D]kind
To make you f[Em]eel obl[Em/F#]iged  [G]to go
[C]ticking through your [D]time
With a p[Em]ained look [Em/F#]in    [G]your
e[C]yes, You give me the f[D]urniture,
we'll d[G]ivide the [Em/F#]photo  g[Em]raphs
Go out to d[C]inner o[Cmaj7]ne more t[Cadd9]ime
Have oursel[C]ves a bottle [Cmaj7]of     w[Cadd9]ine
A[Cadd9]nd a couple of laughs

When first you [G]left
[G]I stayed so [Cmaj7]sad I wouldn't sleep
I know that [C]love's a [Cmaj7]gift, I t[C]hought yours was mine
[Cmaj7]And     s[C]omething that I [Cmaj7]could [G]keep

Now I real[G]ize
[G]that time is not the [Cmaj7]only compromise
a bird in the [C]hand could be an all[Cmaj7] night  s[C]tand
Between[Cmaj7] a blazing [C]fire and a p[Cmaj7]ocket of s[G]kies

So I [C]hope I'm not the [D]kind
To make you f[Em]eel obl[Em/F#]iged  [G]to go
[C]ticking through your [D]time
With a p[Em]ained look [Em/F#]in    [G]your
e[C]yes, I covered the fur[D]niture,
I fr[G]amed the p[Em/F#]hotograp[Em]hs
Went out to[C] dinner[Cmaj7] one more[Cadd9]time
Had m[C]yself a bottl[Cmaj7]e of   w[Cadd9]ine
[Cadd9]and a couple of laughs

Just the other [G]day
[G]I got your l[Cmaj7]etter in the mail
I'm happy for [C]you, its [Cmaj7]been so l[C]ong
You've bee[Cmaj7]n wanting a c[C]abin and a bac[Cmaj7]kwoods t[G]rail

And I think that's [G]great...me...
[G]I seem to [Cmaj7]find myself in school
It's all O[C]k, I just[Cmaj7] want to [C]say
I[Cmaj7]'m so relie[C]ved we didn't d[Cmaj7]o it   c[G]ruel

But ain't life a br[G]ook
J[G]ust when I get to[Cmaj7]feeling like a polished stone
I give me a l[C]ong [Cmaj7]drawn l[C]ook
It[Cmaj7]'s kind of a [C]drag to find yo[Cmaj7]urself a[G]lone

And sometimes I [G]mind
Es[G]pecially when I'm[Cmaj7]waiting on your heart
But life don't c[C]lickety[Cmaj7] clack down a s[C]traight line track
It[Cmaj7] comes to[C]gether and it c[Cmaj7]omes apa[G]rt

Cause I k[C]now you're not the [D]kind
To make me fe[Em]el obli[Em/F#]ged  t[G]o go
[C]ticking through my ti[D]me
with a p[Em]ained look [Em/F#]in   m[G]y
ey[C]es, I sold the furnitu[D]re,
I put a[G]way the ph[Em/F#]otograph[Em]s
Went out to d[C]inner o[Cmaj7]ne last t[Cadd9]ime
had my[C]self a [Cmaj7]bottle of w[Cadd9]ine
[Cadd9]Had a couple of laughs

And wasn't it fi[G]ne....[Cmaj7][C][Cmaj7][C][Cmaj7][C][Cmaj7][G]
