[Verse]
My [E]girl, my girl, don't [A]lie to [G]me
Tell me [B]where did you sleep last [E]night
In the [E]pines, in the pines
Where the [A]sun don't ever [G]shine
I would [B]shiver the whole night [E]through

[Chorus]
My [E]girl, my girl, where [A]will you [G]go
I'm [B]going where the cold wind [E]blows
In the [E]pines, in the pines
Where the [A]sun don't ever [G]shine
I would [B]shiver the whole night [E]through

[Verse]
Her [E]husband, was a hard [A]working [G]man
Just a[B]bout a mile from [E]here
His [E]head was found in a [A]driving [G]wheel
But his [B]body never was [E]found

[Verse]
My [E]girl, my girl, don't [A]lie to [G]me
Tell me [B]where did you sleep last [E]night
In the [E]pines, in the pines
Where the [A]sun don't ever [G]shine
I would [B]shiver the whole night [E]through

[Interlude]
[E] [A][G][B][E]

[Chorus]
My [E]girl, my girl, where [A]will you [G]go
I'm [B]going where the cold wind [E]blows
In the [E]pines, in the pines
Where the [A]sun don't ever [G]shine
I would [B]shiver the whole night [E]through

[Verse]
My [E]girl, my girl, don't [A]lie to [G]me
Tell me [B]where did you sleep last [E]night
In the [E]pines, in the pines
Where the [A]sun don't ever [G]shine
I would [B]shiver the whole night [E]through

My [E]girl, my girl, where [A]will you [G]go
I'm [B]going where the cold wind [E]blows
In the [E]pines, the pines
The [A]sun, the [G]shine
I'll [B]shiver the whole night [E]through
