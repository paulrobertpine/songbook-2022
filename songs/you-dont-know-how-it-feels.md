[Verse 1]
E                   A                   E                   A  (x2)
Let me run with     you tonight    I'll take you on       a moonlight ride
There's someone   I used to see     but she don't    give a damn for me


[Chorus (1)]
         E          B            E            A       
So let's get to the point, let's roll another joint
         E     B             E           A
Turn the radio loud, I'm too alone to be proud
E         D           A
You don't know how it feels
E         D           A               E  D  A  - E  D  A  
You don't know how it feels...to be me


[Verse 2]
E                A                E               A  (x2)
People come, people go, some grow young, some grow cold
I woke up in between a memory and a dream


[Chorus]


[Verse 3]
E                   A                   E                   A  (x2)
My old man was born to rock but he's still tryin' to beat the clock
Think of me what you will, I've still got a little space to fill
