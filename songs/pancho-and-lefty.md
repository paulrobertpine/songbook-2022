C
Living on the road my friend
G
Is gonna keep you free and clean
F
Now you wear your skin like iron
C                      G
Your breath as hard as kerosene
F
Weren't your mama's only son
        C               F
But her favorite one it seems
    Am                	 / F	C / G
She began to cry when you said good-bye
    F              Am 
And sank into your dreams
 
C
Pancho was a bandit, boys, his
G
horse was fast as polished steel
F
He wore his gun outside his pants
    C              G
For all the honest world to feel
F
Pancho met his match you know on the
C              F
border down in Mexico
Am               / F C /G
Nobody heard his dying words
    F                 Am
but that's the way it goes
 
CHORUS
F
All the Federales say 
     C                  F
They could have had him any day
Am              / F  C / G
They only let him hang around
       F          Am
out of kindness I suppose


C
Lefty he can't sing the blues
G
all night long like he used to
F
The dust that Pancho bit down south
C           G
ended up in Lefty's mouth
F
The day they laid poor Pancho low
C               F
Lefty left for Ohio
Am              / F     C /  G
Where he got the bread to   go
       F           Am
there ain't nobody knows
 
CHORUS
(slip away)

C
Poets tell how Pancho fell and
G
Lefty's living in a cheap hotel
F
The borderâ€™s quiet and Cleveland's cold,
C                G
And so the story ends we're told
F
Pancho needs your prayers it's true but
C              F
save a few for Lefty too
Am                / F   C /  G
He only did what he had to   do
    F                Am
and now he's growing old

CHORUS
(go so wrong)

CHORUS
(A few gray Federales say)
(go so wrong)

end Am
