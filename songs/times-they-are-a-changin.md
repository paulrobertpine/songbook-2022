Come [G]gather 'round [Em]people
Wher[C]ever you [G]roam
And ad[G]mit that the [Em]waters
A[C]round you have [D]grown
And ac[G]cept it that [Em]soon
You'll be [C]drenched to the [G]bone.
If your [G]time to [Am]you Is worth [D]savin'
Then you [D]better start [D2/C]swimmin'
          [G/B]        [D/A]
Or you'll sink like a stone
For the [G]times [C]they are a-[D]chan[G]gin

[G . . | Em . . | C . . | G . . | . . . | . . . | . . .]

Come writers and critics
Who prophesize with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won't come again
And don't speak too soon
For the wheel's still in spin
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'.
'Cause the loser now
Will be later to win
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
The battle outside ragin'
Will soon shake your windows *)
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.

Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don't criticize
What you can't understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly agin'.
Please get out of the new one
If you can't lend your hand
For the times they are a-changin'.

The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fadin'.
And the first one now
Will later be last
For the times they are a-changin'.
