[INTRO]
C | | | |

It's [C]knowing that your [Cmaj7]door is always o[C6]pen
And your [C]path is free to walk[Dm]
That [Dm]makes me tend to [Dmmaj7]leave my sleeping [Dm7]bag
Rolled up and [G]stashed behind your[C]couch
And it's [C]knowing I'm not [Cmaj7]shackled
By fo[C6]rgotten words and [C]bonds
And the [C]ink stains that are [C]dried upon some [Dm]line
That [Dm]keeps you on the [Dmmaj7]back  roads
By the [Dm7]rivers of my [G]memory
That [Dm]keeps you ever [G]gentle on my [C]mind

It's not [C]clinging to the rocks[Cmaj7]and ivy
[C6]Planted on their [C]columns now that [Dm]binds me
Or [Dm]something that some[Dmmaj7]bo  -  dy said
Be[Dm7]cause they thought we [G]fit together [C]walking
It's just [C]knowing that the [Cmaj7]world will not be [C6]cursing or for[C]giving
when I [C]walk along some railroad track and [Dm7]find
That you're [Dm]moving on the back[Dmmaj7]roads
By the [Dm7]rivers of my [G]memory
And for [Dm]hours you're just [G]gentle on my [C]mind

Though the [C]wheat fields and the [Cmaj7]clothes lines
And the [C6]junkyards and the [C]highways come be[Dm7]tween us
And some [Dm]other woman's [Dmmaj7]cryin' to her [Dm7]mother
'Cause she [G]turned and I was [C]gone
I [C]still might run in [Cmaj7]silence, tears of [C6]joy might stain my [C]face
And the [C]summer sun might burn me 'til I'm [Dm7]blind
Oh, but [Dm]not to where I [Dmmaj7]cannot see you [Dm7]walkin' on the [G]back roads
By the [Dm]rivers flowing [G]gentle on my [C]mind

I [C]dip my cup of [Cmaj7]soup back from a [C6]gurglin',
Cracklin' [C]cauldron in some [Dm]train yard
My [Dm]beard a rustling, a [Dmmaj7]cold  towel,
and a [Dm7]dirty hat pulled [G]low across my [C]face
Through [C]cupped hands 'round the [Cmaj7]tin  can
I pre[C6]tend to hold you [C]to my breast and [Dm7]find
That you're [Dm]waiting from the [Dmmaj7]back roads
By the [Dm7]rivers of my [G7]memories
Ever [Dm]smilin', ever [G]gentle on my [C]mind[|][Csus4][|][C][|][C7sus4][|][C][|]
