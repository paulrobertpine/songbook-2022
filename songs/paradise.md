W[C]hen I was a child[F] my family wo[C]uld travel,
down to Western Kentucky where my [G7]parents were [C]born
And there's a backwards old town that's [F]often re[C]membered,
so many times that my [G7]memories are [C]worn.

And [C]daddy won't you take me back to [F]Muhlenberg [C]County,
down by the Green River where [G7]Paradise [C]lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're [F]too late in [C]asking,
Mr. Peabody's coal train has [G7]hauled it a[C]way

Well, [C]sometimes we'd travel right [F]down the Green [C]River,
to the abandoned old prison down by [G7]Adrie [C]Hill
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd [F]shoot with our [C]pistols,
but empty pop bottles was [G7]all we would [C]kill.

And [C]daddy won't you take me back to [F]Muhlenberg [C]County,
down by the Green River where [G7]Paradise [C]lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're [F]too late in [C]asking,
Mr. Peabody's coal train has [G7]hauled it a[C]way

Then the [C]coal company came with the [F]world's largest [C]shovel,
and they tortured the timber and [G7]stripped all the [C]land
Well, they dug for their coal till the [F]land was for[C]saken,
then they wrote it all down as the [G7]progress of [C]man.

And [C]daddy won't you take me back to [F]Muhlenberg [C]County,
down by the Green River where [G7]Paradise [C]lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're [F]too late in [C]asking,
Mr. Peabody's coal train has [G7]hauled it a[C]way

When I [C]die let my ashes float [F]down the Green [C]River,
let my soul roll on up to the [G7]Rochester [C]dam
I'll be halfway to Heaven with [F]Paradise [C]waitin',
just five miles away from wher[G7]ever I [C]am.

And [C]daddy won't you take me back to [F]Muhlenberg [C]County,
down by the Green River where [G7]Paradise [C]lay
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're [F]too late in [C]asking,
Mr. Peabody's coal train has [G7]hauled it a[C]way
