[Verse 1]

[A]Ruby, [C#m]let down your golden hair,  when I’m [D]standing at the [Dm]bottom of your stairs
[A]Ruby, [C#m]I can see your TV on,  But the [D]people there they [Dm]flicker and they’re gone
So [D]let down your golden hair for me [A]tonight,  [D]Let down your golden hair for me to c[E]limb


[Chorus]

Just like an [A]old-time telegraph[D] man,  [A]I came here with a simple job to [E]do
Cause that ne[A]ws coming down the wire sa[D]ys that your he[Dm]ad’s on fire
And I'm [A]trying to get a [E]message [D]through to [A]you


[Verse 2]

[A]Ruby, [C#m]you ain't lonely yet With your [D]crystal and your [Dm]Russian cigarette
[A]Ruby, [C#m]haven't you heard before,  what good’s [D]finest tower when it [Dm]hasn't got a door?
[D]So let down your golden hair for me [A]tonight,  [D]Let down your golden hair for me to c[E]limb


[Chorus]

Just like an [A]old-time telegraph [D]man,  [A]I came here with a simple job to [E]do
Cause that ne[A]ws coming down the wire sa[D]ys that your be[Dm]d’s on fire
And I'm [A]trying to get a [E]message [D]through to [A]you


[Instrumental]

[Chorus]

I’m that [A]old-time telegraph [D]man,  [A]I came here with a simple job to [E]do
Cause that ne[A]ws coming down the wire sa[D]ys that your wh[Dm]eels’s on fire
And I'm [A]trying to get a [E]message [D]through to [A]you


[Outro]

Cause that [A]news coming down the wire [D]says that your [Dm]world’s on fire
And I'm [A]trying to get a [E]message [D]through to [A]you
