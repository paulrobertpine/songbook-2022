[C]Slip inside the [G]eye of your [Am]mind
Don't you [E]know you might [F]find[G]
A better place to [C]play[Am][G]
You [C]said that [G]you'd never [Am]been
But all the [E]things that you've [F]seen[G]
Will slowly fade [C]away[Am][G]

[F]So I start a revo-[Fm]lution from my [C]bed
'Cause you [F]said the brains I [Fm]had went to my [C]head.
[F]Step outside, [Fm]summertime's in [C]bloom
[G]Stand up beside the fireplace
[E7/G#]Take that look from off your face
[Am]You ain't ever [G]gonna burn my [| F / / / /|]heart out [| G / / / | / / / / |]

And [C]so [G]Sally can [Am]wait,
she [E]knows it's too [F]late as we're
[G]walking on [C]by[Am][G]
Her [C]soul [G]slides a-[Am]way,
[E] but don't look [F]back in anger
[G]I heard you say[C][G]

[| Am/ / | E/ / | F/ / | G/ / | C/ / | Am/ G/|]

[C]Take me to the [G]place where you [Am]go
Where [E]nobody [F]knows [G]if it's night or [C]day[Am][G]
But [C]please don't put your [G]life in the [Am]hands
Of a [E]Rock n Roll [F]band[G]
Who'll throw it all a-[C]way[Am][G]

I'm gonna [F]start a revo-[Fm]lution from my [C]bed
'Cause you [F]said the brains I [Fm]had went to my [C]head.
[F]Step outside, cuz[Fm]summertime's in [C]bloom
[G]Stand up beside the fireplace
[E7/G#]Take that look from off your face
[Am]You ain't ever [G]gonna burn my [| F / / / /|]heart out [| G / / / | / / / / |]

And [C]so [G]Sally can [Am]wait,
she [E]knows it's too [F]late as we're
[G]walking on [C]by[Am][G]
Her [C]soul [G]slides a-[Am]way,
[E] but don't look [F]back in anger
[G]I heard you say[C][G]
