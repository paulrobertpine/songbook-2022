[E]   And she was l[A]ying in the gr[E]ass
[E]   And she could h[A]ear the highway bre[E]athing
[E]   And she could s[A]ee a nearby fac[E]tory
[E]   She's making s[A]ure she is not dre[E]aming
[Bb]   See the li[F]ghts of the nei[C]ghbor's ho[F]use
[Bb]   Now she's sta[C]rting to r[F]ise
[Bb]   Take a mi[F]nute to [C]concentrat[F]e and she
[Bb]   Opens [G]up her e[C]yes

[E]   The world was mo[A]ving, she was[D] right there w[A]ith it and she [E]was[A][D][A]
[E]   The world was mo[A]ving she was[D] floating ab[A]ove it and she [E]was[A][D][A]
And she w[E]as[A][E][E][A][E]

[E]   And she was dri[A]fting through the bac[E]kyard
[E]   And she was ta[A]king off her dr[E]ess
[E]   And she was mo[A]ving very sl[E]owly
[E]   Rising [A]up above the ea[E]rth
[Bb]   Moving i[F]nto the [C]univers[F]e and she's
[Bb]   Drifting t[C]his way and t[F]hat
[Bb]   Not tou[F]ching the gr[C]ound at a[F]ll and she's
[Bb]   Up a[G]bove the [C]yard

[E]   The world was mo[A]ving, she was[D] right there w[A]ith it and she [E]was[A][D][A]
[E]   The world was mo[A]ving she was[D] floating ab[A]ove it and she [E]was[A][D][A]

And she was[Bm]glad about it, no doubt about it
[G]She isn't sure 'bout what she's done
[Bm]No time to think about what to tell them
[G]   No time to think about what she's done and she [E]was[A][E]
Hey, hey, hey-hey-[E]hey[A][E]

[E]   And she was loo[A]king at her[E]self
[E]   And things were lo[A]oking like a mo[E]vie
[E]   She had a plea[A]sant elev[E]ation
[E]   She's moving o[A]ut in all dir[E]ections

[Bb]   Hey, [F]hey, hey, [C]hey-hey-hey, [F]hey, hey, [Bb]hey, hey, [C]hey-hey-hey, [F]hey
[Bb]   Hey, [F]hey, hey, [C]hey-hey-hey, [F]hey, hey, [Bb]hey, hey, [G]hey-hey-hey, [C]hey


[E]   The world was mo[A]ving, she was[D] right there w[A]ith it and she [E]was[A][D][A]
[E]   The world was mo[A]ving she was[D] floating ab[A]ove it and she [E]was[A][D][A]
[E]   Joining the w[A]orld of[D] missing [A]persons and she [E]was[A][D][A]
[E]   Missing e[A]nough to[D] feel al[A]right and she [E]was[A][D][A]
And she [E]was [A] (x7[D])[A]
[E]And [E]she [E]was
