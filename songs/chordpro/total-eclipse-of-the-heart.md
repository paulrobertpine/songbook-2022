([F#m]Turn around) every now and then I get a [E]little bit lonely
And you're never coming 'round
([F#m]Turn around) every now and then I get a [E]little bit tired
Of listening to the sound of my tears
([A]Turn around) every now and then I get a [G]little bit nervous
That the best of all the years have gone by
([A]Turn around) every now and then I get a [G]little bit terrified
And then I see the look in your eyes
([C]Turn around, [F]bright eyes) every now and then I fall apart
([C]Turn around, [F]bright eyes) every now and then I fall a-[E]part

And I [C#m]need you now to-[A]night
And I [B]need you more than [E]ever
And if you [C#m]only hold me [A]tight
We'll be [B]holding on for-[E]ever
And we'll [C#m]only be making it [A]right
'Cause we'll [B]never be wrong
To-[A]gether we can take it to the [B]end of the line
Your [C#m]love is like a shadow on me [F#/ / / /]all of the time (all of the time)
I [A]don't know what to do and I'm [B]always in the dark
We're [C#m]living in a powder keg and [F#]giving off sparks
I really need you to-[E]night
For-[C#m]ever's gonna start to-[A]night
For-[B]ever's gonna start to-[E]night

Once upon a time I was [C#m]falling in love
But [G#]now I'm only falling a-[A / / / / ]part
There's [F#m]nothing I can do
A [B]total eclipse of the [E]heart [C#m]/ / [A]/ / [B]/ /

[E]Once upon a time there was [C#m]light in my life
But [G#]now there's only love in the [A]dark
[F#m]Nothing I can say
A [B]total eclipse of the [E]heart [C#m]/ / [A]/ / [B]/ /
| [B]/ / / / |

| [F#m]/ / / / | [E]/ / / / | [F#m]/ / / / | [E]/ / / / |
| [A]/ / / / | [G]/ / / / | [A]/ / / / | [G]/ / / / |

([C]Turn around, [F]bright eyes) every now and then I fall apart
([C]Turn around, [F]bright eyes) every now and then I fall a-[E]part

And I [C#m]need you now to-[A]night (and I need you now)
And I [B]need you more than [E]ever
And if you [C#m]only hold me [A]tight (if you only)
We'll be [B]holding on for-[E]ever
And we'll [C#m]only be making it [A]right (and we'll never)
'Cause we'll [B]never be wrong
To-[A]gether we can take it to the [B]end of the line
Your [C#m]love is like a shadow on me [F# / / / / ]all of the time (all of the time)
