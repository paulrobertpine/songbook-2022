[G]Sittin' in the morning [B]sun
I'll be [C]sittin' in the [C]ev[B]en[Bb]ing [A]come
[G]Watching the ships roll [B]in,
then I [C]watch them roll a[C]wa[B]y [Bb]  a[A]gain, yeah

I'm [G]sittin' on the dock of the [E]bay
watching the [G]tide roll a[E]way
ooh I'm just [G]sittin' on the dock of the [A]bay
wasting [G]ti---[E]ime

[G]I left my home in [B]Georgia
[C]Headed for the [C]Fr[B]is[Bb]co b[A]ay
[G]'Cause I've had nothing [B]to live for
and [C]look like nothing's gonna c[C]om[B]e [Bb]my [A]way

I'm [G]sittin' on the dock of the [E]bay
watching the [G]tide roll a[E]way
ooh I'm just [G]sittin' on the dock of the [A]bay
wasting [G]ti---[E]ime

[G]  Look [D]like no[C2]thing's gonna change
[G]       [D]Everything[C2]still remains the same
[G]     I [D]can't do what [C2]ten people [G]tell me to do
[F]   So I guess I'll re[D]main the same

[G]Sittin' here resting my b[B]ones
[C]and this loneliness won't le[C]av[B]e [Bb]me a[A]lone
[G]These 2000 miles I roame[B]d
just to [C]make this do[C]ck[B] m[Bb]y h[A]ome

I'm [G]sittin' on the dock of the [E]bay
watching the [G]tide roll a[E]way
ooh I'm just [G]sittin' on the dock of the [A]bay
wasting [G]ti---[E]ime

[G][E]
