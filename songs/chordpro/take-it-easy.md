Well I'm a [G]runnin' down the road try'n to loosen my load

[G]Four that wanna own me, [D]two that wanna stone me
[C]One says she's a friend of mine[G]

[Chorus]
Take it e[Em]asy, take it e[C]as[G]y
Don't let the [Am]sound of your own [C]wheels drive you c[Em]razy
Lighten u[C]p while you still [G]can
Don't even [C]try to underst[G]and
Just find a [Am]place to make your s[C]tand,  and take it e[G]asy

Well, I'm a s[G]tandin' on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
Such a fine [D]sight to [C]see

Come on, [Em]ba-[D]by, don't say [C]may[G]be
I gotta [Am]know if your sweet [C]love is gonna s[Em]ave me
