When you were here be[G]fore, couldn't look you in the [B]eyes
You're just like an [C]angel, your skin makes me [Cm]cry
You float like a [G]feather in a beautiful [B]world
I wish I was [C]special, you're so very [Cm]special

But I'm a [G]creep, I'm a [B]weirdo
What the hell am I doing [C]here? I don't be-[Cm]long here

I don't care if it [G]hurts, I wanna have con[B]trol
I want a perfect [C]body, I want a perfect [Cm]soul
I want you to [G]notice when I'm not a[B]round
You're so very [C]special I wish I was [Cm]special

But I'm a [G]creep, I'm a [B]weirdo
What the hell am I doing [C]here? I don't be[Cm]long here

Oooh, oooh, [G]she's running out a-[B]gain...
[C]She's running out, she [Cm]run, run, run...
[G]Ruuuuu-[B]uuun...
[C]Ruuuuu-[Cm]uuuuuun...

Whatever makes you [G]happy, whatever you [B]want
You're so very [C]special, I wish I was [Cm]special

But I'm a [G]creep, I'm a [B]weirdo
What the hell am I doing [C]here? I don't be-[Cm]long here
I don't be-[G]long here
