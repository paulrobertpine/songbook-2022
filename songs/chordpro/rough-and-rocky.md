[G]Darling, I have [C]come to[G]tell you
Though it almost breaks my [D]heart
[G]But before the [C]morning, [G]darling
[D]We'll be many miles [G]apart

(chorus)
[C]Don't this road look rough and [G]rocky
Don't that sea look wide and [D]deep
[G]Don't my baby [C]look the [G]sweetest
[D]when she's in my arms [G]asleep


[G]Can't you hear the [C]nightbirds [G]crying
Far across the deep blue [D]sea
[G]While the others [C]you are [G]thinking
[D]Won't you sometimes think of [G]me

(chorus)

[G]One more kiss be-[C]fore I [G]leave you
One more kiss before we [D]part
[G]You have caused me [C]lots of [G]trouble
[D]darling, you have broke my [G]heart

(chorus)
