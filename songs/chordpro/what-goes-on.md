[D]     [D]    
What goes [D]on in your [D]mind
I think that [C] I am [G]falling [D]down
What goes [D]on in your [D]mind
I think that[C] I am[G] upside [D]down

[Chorus]
Lady be [A]good, do what you[G] should
You know it'll [D]work all right[D]
Lady be [A]good, do what you[G] should
You know it'll [D]be all [D]right

I'm goin' [D]up, and I'm goin'[D] down
I'm gonna [C]fly from [G]side to [D]side
See the [D]bells up in the[D] sky
Somebody [C]cut the[G] string in[D] two

[Chorus]

One minute [D]one, and one[D] minute two
One minute [C]up, and [G]one minute [D]down
What goes [D]on in your [D]mind
I think that[C] I am[G] falling[D] down

[Chorus]
