Your cheatin' [G]heart
Will make you [C]weep
You'll cry and [D]cry
And try to [G]sleep
But sleep won't [G]come
The whole night [C]through
Your cheatin' [D]heart
Will tell on [G]you

When tears come [C]down
Like falling [G]rain
You'll toss a-[A7]round
And call my [D]name
You'll walk the [G]floor
The way I [C]do
Your cheatin' [D]heart
Will tell on [G]you

Your cheatin' [G]heart
Will pine some [C]day
And crave the [D]love
You threw a-[G]way
The time will [G]come
When you'll be [C]blue
Your cheatin' [D]heart
Will tell on [G]you

When tears come [C]down
Like falling [G]rain
You'll toss a-[A7]round
And call my [D]name
You'll walk the [G]floor
The way I [C]do
Your cheatin' [D]heart
Will tell on [G]you
