[G]If you could read my mind love
[F]What a tale my thoughts could tell
[G]Just like an old time movie
[F]'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
[G]In a castle da[G7]rk or a for[C]tress strong
With [D]chains upon my [Em]feet
You [C]know that ghost is [G]me
And [C]I will never [G/B]be set free
As [Am7]long as I'm a [D]ghost that you can't[G]see

[G]

[G]If I could read your mind love
[F]What a tale your thoughts could tell
[G]Just like a paperback novel
[F]The kind that drugstores sell
[G]When you reach the pa[G7]rt where the he[C]artaches come
The [D]hero would be [Em]me
But [C]heroes often [G]fail
And [C]you won't read that [G/B]book again
Bec[Am7]ause the ending's [D]just too hard to[G]take

[G] [F][G][F]

[G]I'd walk aw[G7]ay like a mo[C]vie star
Who gets [D]burned in a three way [Em]script
[C]Enter number [G]two
A [C]movie queen to [G/B]play the scene
Of [Am7]bringing all the [D]good things out in[Em]me
[C]But for now love, let's be [G/B]real
I [C]never thought I could [G/B]act this way 
And I've [Am7]got to say that I [D]just don't get it
[C]I don't know where [G/B]we went wrong
But the [Am7]feelin's gone
And I [D]just can't get it [G]back

[G]

[G]If you could read my mind love
[F]What a tale my thoughts could tell
[G]Just like an old time movie
[F]'bout a ghost from a wishin' well
[G]In a castle d[G7]ark or a fo[C]rtress strong
With [D]chains upon my [Em]feet
But [C]stories always [G]end
And [C]if you read [G/B]between the lines
You'll [Am7]know that I'm just [D]tryin' to under[Em]stand
The [C]feelin's that you [G/B]lack
I [C]never thought I could [G/B]feel this way
And I've [Am7]got to say that I [D]just don't get it
[C]I don't know where [G/B]we went wrong
[Am7]But the feelin's gone
And I [D]just can't get it [G]back
