A  A  D A x3

A
D			A		D	A
I’ve seen the time pass over me 
D			A				D	  A
And I am a witness to the flowing of the sea
A4						   A
And I know my children will bury me
A			Bm			D			A
Like my Daddy before me it’ll come eventually

So I say children, why do you cry
Don’t waste your time asking why
Don’t want to know what’s on the other side
Just like all things around you it’s the way it has to be

		D			A
I see the cold season’s coming
		    Bm
I hear the funeral bells ring

            A	      Bm      D             A
What is the life of a man any more than the leaves?

In the town that I call home
There is a tree that’s weathered storm
Beneath its branches I have grown
And all around it, the people I have known
And like the seasons, I’ve seen them come and go
Dropped away the ones I’d love to know

A                     Bm        D             A
What is the life of a man any more than the leaves? X4

D			A
I see the cold seasons coming
			Bm
I hear the funeral bells ring

A                     Bm        D             A
What is the life of a man any more than the leaves?
