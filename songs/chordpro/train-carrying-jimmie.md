 [G]   Come along my  [G7]    dear the  [C]   time is growing  [G]near
I want you to  [Em]    walk down to where the  [A7]    field is over  [D]   grown  [D7]
 [G]   Consumption's claimed his  [G7]    life and we  [C]   dare not miss the  [G]sight
Of the  [Em]    train carrying  [D]   Jimmie [D7]    Rodgers home  [G]

 [G]   We've had some hard  [G7]    times these  [C]   last few years  [G]
Lost our  [Em]    farm - almost  [A7]    lost our spirits,  [D]   too  [D7]
But  [G]   it's the strangest  [G7]    thing when we  [C]   hear that brakeman  [G]sing
we  [Em]    knew that some  [D]   how we'd  [D7]    made it  [G]through.

I can  [C]hear that whistle blow
That old  [G]train is rollin' slow
Sounds like its  [Em]    crying for the  [A7]    singing brakeman  [D]   too  [D7]
Down to the  [G]   sunny south he'll  [G7]    go and he'll  [C]   never roam no  [G]more
Here comes the  [Em]    train oh hold me  [D]   close oh  [D7]    sweetheart, do  [G]

 [G]   Come my little  [G7]    son and  [C]   let me hold you up  [G]
I want you to  [Em]    remember this  [A7]    day when you are  [D]   grown  [D7]
How your  [G]   mama and your  [G7]    dad were so  [C]   proud and so  [G]sad
Watching the  [Em]    train carrying  [D]   Jimmie [D7]    Rodgers home  [G]
There goes the  [Em]    train carrying  [D]   Jimmie [D7]    Rodgers home  [G]

[C](Yo[G]del[D] aw[D7]ay h[G]ere...)
