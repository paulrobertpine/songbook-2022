Well the n[G]ight came undone like a party dress
And fell at her feet in a b[D]eautiful mess
The sm[G]oke and whisky came home in her cu[C]rls
And crept through the dr[G]eams of the [D]barroom g[G]irls

She tos[G]ses and turns 'cause the sun is unkind
And the heat of the day is coming i[D]n through the blinds
S[G]ave all your blue skies for the rest of the wo[C]rld
'Cause the neon sh[G]ines for the b[D]arrooms gi[G]rls

The b[D]arroom girls go [G]by your side
Like the p[A]onies you pass on a c[D]arousel ride
And a[G]ll of the colours go round in a sw[C]irl
When you dance in the a[G]rms of the b[D]arroom gi[G]rls

Now she ro[G]lls to her feet 'cause she can't sleep no more
And looks at the clothes laying o[D]ut on the floor
L[G]ast night's spangles and yesterday's pe[C]arls
Are the bright morning st[G]ars of the b[D]arroom gi[G]rls
