[F]It's a g[Am]od-awful small affair[Cm/Eb]
To the girl[D7]with the mousy hair
[Gm] But her [Gm/F]mummy is yelling "No"[C7]
And her daddy has told her to go
[F]But her [Am]friend is nowhere to be seen[Cm/Eb]
Now she wal[D7]ks through her sunken dream.
[Gm]To the seat[Gm/F] with the clearest view[C7]
And she's hooked to the silver screen

[Ab]But the f[Abaug]ilm is a saddening bore[Fm]
For she's live[Ab7]d it ten times or more
[Db]She could spi[Dbaug]t in the eyes of fools[Bbm]
As they ask h[Db7]er to focus on

[Bb]Sailors fig[Eb]hting in the dance hall
[Gm7]Oh man! lo[Gbaug]ok at those cavemen go[F] [Fm]It's the freakiest show[Cm7] [Ebm7]Take a look at the
[Bb]lawman [Eb]Beating up the wrong guy
[Gm]Oh man! Won[Gbaug]der if he'll ever know
[F] [Fm]He's in the best selling show[Cm7] [Ebm7]Is there life on
Ma[Gm7]rs?[Gbaug] [Bb] [C/E]

[F] [Gbdim] [Gm] [Abdim] [Am] [Bb] [Bbm]

[F]It's on [Am]Amerika's tortured brow[Cm/Eb]
That Mickey[D7]Mouse has grown up a cow
[Gm]Now the wor[Gm/F]kers have struck for fame[C7]
'Cause Lennon's on sale again[F]See the [Am]mice in their million hordes[Cm/Eb]
From Ibeza [D7]to the norfolk broads
[Gm]Rule Britan[Gm/F]nia is out of bounds[C7]
To my mother, my dog, and clowns

[Ab]But the f[Abaug]ilm is a saddening bore[Fm]
For I've writ [Ab7]it ten times or more
[Db]It's about to[Dbaug] be writ again[Bbm]
As I ask you [Db7]to focus on

[Bb]Sailors fig[Eb]hting in the dance hall
[Gm7]Oh man! lo[Gbaug]ok at those cavemen go[F] [Fm]It's the freakiest show[Cm7] [Ebm7]Take a look at the 
lawma[Bb]n [Eb]Beating up the wrong guy
[Gm]Oh man! Won[Gbaug]der if he'll ever know
[F] [Fm]He's in the best selling show[Cm7] [Ebm7]Is there life on
Ma[Gm7]rs?[Gbaug] [Bb] [C/E] [F]
