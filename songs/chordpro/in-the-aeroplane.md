[G] [Em][C][D]

[G]What a beautiful f[Em]ace
I have found in this pl[C]ace
that is circling a[D]ll around the sun.
[G]What a beautiful dr[Em]eam
that could flash on the sc[C]reen
in a blink of an e[D]ye and be gone from m[G]e
soft a[Em]nd sweet
let me ho[C]ld it close and ke[D]ep it here with m[G]e[Em][C][D]

[G]and one day we wil[Em]l die
and our ashes will fly [C]from the aeroplane [D]over the sea
[G]but for now we are [Em]young
let us lay in the [C]sun
and count every [D]beautiful thing we can[G]see
Love to [Em]be
in the ar[C]ms of all I'm [D]keepin here with [G]me[Em][C][D]

[G]what a curious l[Em]ife we have found here to[C]night
there is music that [D]sounds from the street
[G]there are lights in the [Em]cloud
*Anna's ghost all a[C]round
hear her voice as it's [D]rolling and ringing [G]through me
soft a[Em]nd sweet
How the n[C]otes all bend and [D]reach above the t[G]ree[Em]s[C][D]

[Em]     now how I remember yo[C]u
how I would push my fingers throug[G]h
your mouth to make those muscles mov[D]e
that make your voice so smooth and swee[Em]t
And now we keep where we don't kno[C]w
All secrets sleep in winter clothe[G]s
with one you loved so long ag[D]o

now he don't even know his name

[Em] [C]  [G]  [D]   [D]  

[G]What a beautiful f[Em]ace
I have found in this pl[C]ace
that is circling a[D]ll around the sun.
[G]And when we meet on a [Em]cloud
I'll be laughing out [C]loud
I'll be laughing with [D]everyone I s[G]ee
Can't b[Em]elieve
how [C]strange it is to be [D]anything at [G]all[Em][C][D][G]
