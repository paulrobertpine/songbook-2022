[C]Riding on the [G]city of New [C]Orleans
[Am]Illinois Central [F]Monday morning [C]rail[G]
There are [C]fifteen cars and [G]fifteen restless [C]riders
[Am]Three conductors and [G]twenty-five sacks of [C]mail

There all [Am]out on this southbound odyssey
And the [Em]train pulls out of Kankakee
[G]Rolls past the houses, farms and [D]fields
[Am]Passin' towns that have no names
And [Em]freight yards full of old black men
And the [G]graveyards of [G7]rusted automo-[C]biles[C7]

Singin' [F]"good morning America, how [C]are ya?"
Sayin' [Am]"don't ya know me? [F]I'm your native [C]son[G]"
Yes, I'm the [C]train they call the [G]City of New [C]Orleans
And I'll be [Bb]gone [F]500 [G]miles when [G7]day is [C]done

And I was [C]dealing cards with the [G]old men in the [C]club car
And it's [Am]penny a point, there ain't [F]no one keeping [C]score[G]
Won't ya [C]pass that paper [G]bag that holds that [C]bottle
You can [Am]feel the wheels [G]grumbling through the [C]floor

And the [Am]sons of Pullman porters; the [Em]sons of engineers
They ride their [G]father's magic carpet made of [D]steel
And [Am]mothers with the babes asleep
Go [Em]rockin' to the gentle beat
And the [G]rhythm of the [G7]rails is all they [C]dream[C7]

Singin' [F]"good morning America, how [C]are ya?"
Sayin' [Am]"don't ya know me? [F]I'm your native [C]son[G]"
Yes, I'm the [C]train they call the [G]City of New [C]Orleans
And I'll be [Bb]gone [F]500 [G]miles when [G7]day is [C]done

[C]Nighttime on the [G]City of New [C]Orleans
[Am]Changing cars in [F]Memphis, Tennes-[C]see[G]
It's [C]halfway home and [G]we'll be there by [C]morning
Through the [Am]Mississippi darkness [G]rolling to the [C]sea
And [Am]all the towns and people
They seem to [Em]fade into a bad dream
The [G]old steel rails, it ain't heard the [D]news
The con-[Am]ductor sings that song again
Its [Em]passengers will please refrain
This [G]train's got the [G7]disappearing railroad [C]blues[C7]

Just a-singin' [F]"good night America, how [C]are ya?"
Sayin' [Am]"don't ya know me? [F]I'm your native [C]son[G]"
And, I'm the [C]train they call the [G]City of New [C]Orleans
And I'll be [Bb]gone [F]500 [G]miles when [G7]day is [C]done

Just a-singin' [F]"good night America, how [C]are ya?"
Sayin' [Am]"don't ya know me? [F]I'm your native [C]son[G]"
And, I'm the [C]train they call the [G]City of New [C]Orleans
And I'll be [Bb?]gone a [F]long, long [G]time when the day is
