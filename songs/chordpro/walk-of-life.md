[E] [A] [B] [A] [B]x4

[E]Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies  
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
[A]He got the action, He got the motion  Oh[E]Yeah the boy can play
[A]Dedication, devotion  [E]Turning all the night time into the day

[E]He do the song about the sweet lovin' [B]woman
He do the [E]song about the knife[A]
He do the [E7]walk,[B] he do the walk of [A]life. Yeah[B], he do the walk of [E]life[A] [B] [A] [B]

[E]Here comes Johnny and he'll tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat, the talkin' blues
[A]He got the action, He got the motion
[E]Yeah the boy can play
[A]Dedication, devotion
[E]Turning all the night time into the day

[E]He do the song about the sweet lovin' [B]woman
He do the [E]song about the knife
He do the [E7]walk[B], he do the walk of [A]life.  [B]Yeah, he do the walk of [E]lif[A]e[B] [A] [B]

[E]Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies  
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay
[A]He got the action, He got the motion  Oh[E]Yeah the boy can play
[A]Dedication, devotion  [E]Turning all the night time into the day

[E]And after all the violence and [B]double talk
There's just a [E]song in all the trouble and the [A]strife
You do the [E7]walk[B], you do the walk of [A]life. Yea[B]h, you do the walk of [E]lif[A]e[B] [A] [B]
