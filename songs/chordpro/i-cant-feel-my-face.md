G F Am

        G                                  F
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb.
             Am
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come.
         G                                 F
But at least we'll both be beautiful and stay forever young.
        Am
This I know, yeah, this I know.

                   G       F    
She told me "Don't worry about it‚Äù.
                    Am
She told me "Don't worry no more
                G         F
We both knew we can't go without it.
                   Am                   
She told me you'll never be in love oh oh oooh.

G                                    F        Am   
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it.
G                                    F        Am   
I can't feel my face when I'm with you, but I love it, but I love it.

       G                                  F
And I know she'll be the death of me, at least we'll both be numb.
            Am
And she'll always get the best of me, the worst is yet to come.
         G                     F
All the misery was necessary when we're deep in love.
       Am
This I know, girl, this I know.
