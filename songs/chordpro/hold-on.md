[D.]They hung a sign up [G...]in our town
"if you [A.]live it up, you won't [D...]live it down"
So, [D.]she left Monte [G...]Rio, son
Just [A7.]like a bullet [D.......]leaves a gun
With her [G.]charcoal eyes and [A...]Monroe hips
She went and [D.]took that Cali-[G.....]fornia trip
Well, the [Em.]moon was gold, her [A7...]Hair like wind
She said [Em.]don't look back just [A7.....]Come on Jim
Oh you've got to

[D]Hold on, [A7]Hold on
[D]You got to [G]hold on
[D]Take my hand, I'm [A7]standing right here
You gotta [D.......]hold on

Well, he gave her a dimestore watch
And a ring made from a spoon
Everyoneâ€™s looking for someone to blame
When you share my bed, you share my name
Well, go ahead and call the cops
You don't meet nice girls in coffee shops
She said baby, I still love you
Sometimes there's nothin left to do
Oh but you've got to

[D]Hold on, [A7]Hold on
[D]You got to [G]hold on
[D]Take my hand, I'm [A7]standing right here
You gotta [D.......]hold on

Well, God bless your crooked little heart
St. Louis got the best of me
I miss your broken China voice
How I wish you were still here with me
Oh, you build it up, you wreck it down
Then you burn your mansion to the ground
Oh, there's nothing left to keep you here
But when you're falling behind in this big blue world
Oh but you've got to

[D]Hold on, [A7]Hold on
[D]You got to [G]hold on
[D]Take my hand, I'm [A7]standing right here
You gotta [D.......]hold on

Down by the Riverside motel,
It's 10 below and falling
By the 99 cent store
she closed her eyes and started swaying
But it's so hard to dance that way
When it's cold and there's no music
Well your old hometown is so far away
But, inside your head there's a record playing,
a song called

[D]Hold on, [A7]Hold on
[D]You got to [G]hold on
[D]Take my hand, I'm [A7]standing right here
You gotta [D.......]hold on (x4)

[D]You gotta hold on...
