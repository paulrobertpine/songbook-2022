|[C] [Am7] |[Dm7] [G7] | or 
|[C] [A7]  |[Dm7] [G7] | 

Don't know why
There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all the time

[F]When he went [G7]away, the blues walked [C]in and [C7]met me
[F]If he stays [G7]away, old rocking [C]chair will [C7]get me
[F]All I do is [G7]pray the Lord a[C]bove will [Am7]let me
[A7]Walk in the [D7]sun once [G7]more

Can't go on
All I have in life is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time

Can't go on
Everything I had is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps rainin' all the time
Keeps rainin' all the time
