 [B-E-B-E]

 [B]  when you motor away [E]beyond the once-red lips
 [B]  when you free yourself[E]from the chance of a lifetime
 [B]  you can be anyone they [E]told you to
   you can belittle every[G#m]little voice that told you so
   and then the [D#]time will come when you add up the numbers
 [G#m]  and then the time will come [D#]when you motor away
 [F#]  oh [F#/F]why don't you just [F#/E]drive a[F#]way
 [B]  when you motor away [E]down the icy streets
 [B]  you can't lie to yourself [E]that its the chance of a lifetime
 [B]  you can be anyone they [E]told you to
   you can belittle every [G#m]little voice that told you so
   and the [D#]time will come when you add up the numbers
 [G#m]  and then the time will come[D#]when you motor away
 [F#]  oh[F#/F] why don't you just[F#/E]drive away

 (solo starts)

   come[B] on   [E]        speed [B]on[E]

[B-E-B-E-B]
