There's [G]gotta be a [Gsus]song left to [G]sing
'Cause everybody can't have thought of every-[D]thing
One little song that ain't been sung
One little rag that ain't been wrung out com-[G]pletely yet
That's got a [D]little left

[C]One little drop of falling rain
[Bm]One little chance to try again
[Am]One little bird that makes it home [G]now and then
[C]One little piece of endless sky
[Bm]One little taste of cherry pie
[Am]One little week in paradise and [D]I start thinking

There's [G]gotta be a [Gsus]song left to[G]sing
'Cause everybody can't have thought of every-[D]thing
One little note that ain't been used
One little word ain't been abused a [G]thousand times
In a [D]thousand rhymes

[C]One little drop of falling rain
[Bm]One little chance to try again
[Am]One little bird that makes it every [G]now and then
[C]One little piece of endless sky
[Bm]One little taste of cherry pie
[Am]One little week in paradise and [D]I start thinking

There's [G]gotta be a [Gsus]song left to[G]sing
'Cause everybody can't have thought of every-[D]thing
One little song that ain't been sung
One little rag that ain't been wrung out com-[G]pletely yet
'Til there's [D]nothing left
