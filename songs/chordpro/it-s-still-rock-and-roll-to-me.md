[C]What's the matter with the [Em]clothes I'm wearing?
"Can't you [Bb]tell that your tie's too wide?[F]"
[C]Maybe I should buy some [Em]old tab collars?
"Welcome [Bb]back to the age of [F]jive.
[Em]Where have you been hidin' [Am]out lately, honey?
You [Em]can't dress trashy till you [D]spend a lot of [G]money."

[C]Everybody [Em]talking 'bout the [Bb]new sound.
[F]Funny, but it's [Am]still rock and [G]roll to [C]me.

[C]What's the matter with the [Em]car I'm driving?
"Can't ya [Bb]tell that it's out of [F]style?"
[C]Should I get a set of [Em]white wall tires?
"Are you [Bb]gonna cruise the miracle [F]mile?
[Em]Nowadays you can't be [Am]too sentimental.
Your [Em]best bet's a true baby [D]blue Conti[G]nental."


[C]Hot funk, [Em]cool punk [Bb]even if it's [F]old junk,
it's [Am]still rock and [G]roll to [C]me.


[C]Oh   [G] it doesn't matter what they [F]say in the papers,
'cause it's [E]always been the same old scene.[Am]
There's a [G]new band in town but you [F]can't get the sound
from a [E]story in a magazine.[Ab]
[Eb]aimed at your average teen.[F][G]


[C]How about a pair of [Em]pink sidewinders
and a [Bb]bright orange pair of [F]pants?
[C]"Well, you could really be a [Em]Beau Brummel baby,
if you [Bb]just give it half a [F]chance.[Em]
Don't waste your money on a [Am]new set of speakers.
You [Em]get more mileage from a[D] cheaper pair of[G]sneakers."

[C]Next phase, [Em]new wave, [Bb]dance craze, [F]anyways
it's [Am]still rock and [G]roll to [C]me.

[C]What's the matter with the [Em]crowd I'm seeing?
"Don't [Bb]know that they're out of [F]touch?"
[C]Should I try to be a [Em]straight 'A' student?"
If You [Bb]are, then you think too [F]much."[Em]
[Em]"Don't you know about the [Am]new fashion, honey?
[Em]All you need are looks and a [D]whole lotta[G]money."


It's the [C]next phase, [Em]new wave, [Bb]dance craze; [F]anyways
it's [Am]still rock and [G]roll to me[C].[C]

[C]Everybody's [Em]talking about the n[Bb]ew sound.
F[F]unny, but it's [G]still rock and roll to me[C9].
