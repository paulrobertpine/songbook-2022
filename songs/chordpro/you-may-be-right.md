[Verse 1]
[A]Friday night I crashed your party,

Saturday I said I'm sorry
Sunday came and trashed me out agai[E7]n
I was o[Bm]nly having fun,
Wasn't hu[G]rting anyone
And we a[E]ll enjoyed the
Weekend for a cha[A]nge

I've been s[A]tranded in the combat zone,

I walked through Bedford Stuy alone
Even rode my motorcycle in the ra[E7]in
And you t[Bm]old me not to drive,
But I m[G]ade it home alive
So you sa[E]id that only proves that I'm insa[A]ne[A]

[Chorus]
You may be right,[E]
I may be crazy[A]
Oh, but it ju[E]st may be a lu[D]natic
You're l[F#m]ooking for[A]
Turn out the light,[E]
Don't try to save me[A]
You may be wr[D]ong for all I k[E]now,
But you may be rig[A]ht

(Play Intro lick x4)

[Verse 2]
[A]Remember how I found you there
Alone in your electric chair
I told you dirty jokes until you sm[E7]iled
You were l[Bm]onely for a man
I said "Ta[G]ke me as I am"
'Cause you mi[E]ght enjoy some madness for a w[A]hile

[A]Now think of all the years you tried to
Find someone to satisfy you
I might be as crazy as you s[E7]ay
If I'm c[Bm]razy then it's true
That it's a[G]ll because of you
And you w[E]ouldn't want me any other w[A]ay

[Chorus]
You may be right,[E]
I may be crazy[A]
Oh, but it ju[E]st may be a lu[D]natic
You're l[F#m]ooking for[A]
It's too late to fight[E]
It's too late to chang[A]e me
You may be wr[D]ong for all I k[E]now,
But you may be rig[A]ht

[A] [E7][Bm][G][E][A]

[Chorus]
You may be right,[E]
I may be crazy[A]
Hey, but it j[E]ust may be a l[D]unatic
You're l[F#m]ooking for[A]
Turn out the light,[E]
Don't try to save me[A]
You may be wr[D]ong for all I k[E]now,
But you may be rig[A]ht

[Outro]
[A]You may be wrong but you may be right[A][A]
[A]You may be wrong but you may be right[A][A]
[A]You may be wrong but you may be right[A][A]
[A]You may be wrong but you may be right[A][A]
