[G]I hear the drums [Bm]echoing to-[Em]night
[G/D]She hears only [F]whispers of some [Am]quiet conver-[Em]sa-[F / / / Am /]tion
[G]She's coming [Bm]in twelve thirty [Em]flight the [G/D]moonlit wings
[F]Reflect the stars that [Am]guide me toward sal-[Em]va-[F / / / Am /]tion
[G]I stopped an [Bm]old man along the [Em]way
[G/D]Hoping to find some [F]long forgotten [Am]words or ancient [Em]melo-[F / / / Am /]dies
[G]He turned to [Bm]me as if to [Em / / / / ]say hurry boy, it's [F / / / ]waiting there for [Am / / / / /]you

[Dm]Gonna take a [Bb]lot to drag me a-[F]way from [C]you
[Dm]There's nothing that a [Bb]hundred men or [F]more could ever [C]do
[Dm]I bless the [Bb]rains down in [F]Af-[C]rica
[Dm]Gonna take some [Bb]time to do the [F]things we never [Am]ha-[C]a-[Dm]ad

[G]The wild dogs [Bm]cry out in the [Em]night
[G]As they grow restless [F]longing for some [Am]solitary [Em]compa-[F / / / Am /]ny
[G]I know that [Bm]I must do what's [Em]right, as sure as
[G/D]Kilimanjaro [F]rises like [Am]Olympus above the [Em]Serenge-[F / / / Am /]ti
[G]I seek to [Bm]cure what's deep in-[Em]side
[Em]Frightened of this [F / / / ]thing that I've be-[Am / / / / /]come
