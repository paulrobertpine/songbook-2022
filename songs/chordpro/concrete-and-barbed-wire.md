This [G]wall divides us,[C] on two different[G]sides
[C]But this wall is not [G]real
[C]How can it be [G]real
It's only made of [D]concrete and barbed [G]wire


[C]Concrete and barbed [G]wire
[C]Concrete and barbed [G]wire
It's only made of [D]concrete and barbed [G]wire

[G]Back in Algiers my [C]darling broke my [G]heart
But he can't seem to break down this [D]wall
[G]With two strong hands he couldn't [C]move it at [G]all
And it's only made of c[D]oncrete and barbed [G]wire


[C]Concrete and barbed [G]wire
[C]Concrete and barbed [G]wire
It's only made of [D]concrete and barbed [G]wire

[G]Down in Opelousas [C]dogs are at the [G]gate
And they're mean lord they're [D]mean
There's a[G] wall between us, but [C]it's not what it [G]seems
It's only made of [D]concrete and barbed [G]wire


[C]Concrete and barbed [G]wire
[C]Concrete and barbed [G]wire
It's only made of [D]concrete and barbed [G]wire

[G]Somewhere in Louisiana,  my [C]sugar's doing [G]time
But he can't spend time with [D]me
If he[G] could get over,  this [C]wall he'd s[G]ee
That it's only made of co[D]ncrete and barbed [G]wire


[C]Concrete and barbed [G]wire
[C]Concrete and barbed [G]wire
It's only made of [D]concrete and barbed [G]wire
