[G]  Watch out [G]     [F]you might get what you're after
[G]  Cool [G]bab[G]ies   [F]strange but not a stranger
[G]           I'm [G]an [F]ord-in-ar-y [G]guy
[A7]Burning down the [F]house

[G]  Hold tight  [G]     [F]wait till the party's over
[G]  Hold ti[G]ght [G]     [F]We're in for nasty weather
[G]     There has [G]got  [F]to  be  a  [G]way
[A7]Burning down the [F]house

Here's your ticket pack your bag: time for jumpin' overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far, Maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire

[G]  All wet [G]    [F]hey you might need a raincoat
[G]  Shake[G]dow[G]n  [F]dreams walking in broad daylight
[G]Three hun-[G]dred [F]six-ty five de-[G]grees
[A7]Burning down the [F]house

It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work baby what did you except
Gonna burst into flame

[A7]Burning down the [F]house

[G]  My house [G]    [F]S'out of the ordinary
[G]  That's [G]mig[G]ht   [F]Don't want to hurt nobody
[G]Some things sure [G]can s[F]weep me off my [G]feet
[A7]Burning down the [F]house

No visible means of support and you have not seen nuthin' yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect starring into the TV set
Fighting fire with fire
