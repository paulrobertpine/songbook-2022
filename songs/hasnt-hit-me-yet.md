[Em]Hey [G]Hey I guess it [D]hasn't hit me [A]yet
[Em]I fell thru this [G]crack
And I [D]kinda lost my [A]head

[Em]Watching the [G]snow fall on this [D]co-[A]old December night

[Em]And out in the [G]middle of Lake [D]Ontari[A]o
The [Em]same snow is [G]falling
On the [Em]deep silent [G]water
The [Em]great dark [G]wonder
[G]Into the [D]waves of my [A]heart
[G]Into the [D]waves of my [A]heart
of my heart
