capo 2

[C]Call me when you're coming to [G]town
Just as s[F]oon as your plane puts d[C]own
Call me on the teleph[G]one
But o[F]nly if you're travelling al[C]one[E7][Am]
Counting down the [C]hours
Through the sunshine [C7]and the s[F]howers
Today's the d[C]ay
You're f[F]inally going to [Dm7]come my [C]way

[C]Let's make a date to see a mov[G]ie
Some f[F]oreign film from gay Par[C]is
I know you like to think you've got [G]taste
So I'll [F]let you choose the time and [C]place[E7][Am]
Have some dinner for [C]two
In some east side [C7]rendezv[F]ous
Then we'll [C]walk
Arm in [F]arm around the [Dm7]block and [C]talk

jam over chords

[Em]To-[Am]night [C]you're [C7]mine
[C7]Let's [F]not [Dm7]waste [G]time

I d[D]o believe the die is [A]cast
Let's t[G]ry and make the night-time [D]last
And I don't know where it's coming f[A]rom but
I want to k[G]iss you till my mouth gets n[D]umb[F#7][Bm]
I want to make love to y[D]ou
Till the day comes brea[D7]king [G]through
And when the sun is high in the [A7]sky
N/C                    D   A7  D
We'll kiss and say goodbye
