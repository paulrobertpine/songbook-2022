[E]Oh bright minds of [B]poverty
[E]Hold on to your heart won [B]liberties
And dis[E]card your store-bought re[B]alities
Don’t let them [F#]take the joy that you [E]make
On your [B]own
[E]Work when you need to [B]maybe
[E]Don’t let ‘em bleed you [B]baby
They do [E]nothing more than feed you [B]lady
Don’t let them [F#]take the joy that you [E]make
On your [B]own

[F#]Don’t fuss, don’t fight it [B]no
[F#]Take that wrong and right it [B]ho
[F#]Can always live on rice and po[E]tatoes
[F#]Take your heart’s candle and re[E]light it
[E]  I [F#]quit my [B]job
[E]  I [F#]quit my [B]job
[E]  I [F#]quit my [B]job
[E]  I’m[F#] free t[B]oday

Should [E]be proud of where I [B]am
All my [E]friends work their dreams with their [B]hands
And [E]truly this is the promised [B]land
Don’t let them [F#]take the joy that you [E]make
On your [B]own
[E]Don’t kill yourself about [B]making it
Just be [E]takin it easy but be [B]takin it
There’s e[E]nough out there who are [B]fakin it
Don’t let them [F#]take the joy that you [E]make
On your [B]own

[F#]Don’t fuss, don’t fight it [B]no
[F#]Take that wrong and right it [B]ho
[F#]Can always live on rice and po[E]tatoes
[F#]Take your heart’s candle and re[E]light it
[E]I q[F#]uit my j[B]ob
[E]I q[F#]uit my j[B]ob
[E]I q[F#]uit my j[B]ob
[E]I’m [F#]free to[B]day
