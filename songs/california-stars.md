INTRO
[G] [D][C][G]

I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight
On a be[D]d of California stars
I'd like to la[C]y my weary bones tonight
On a be[G]d of California stars

I'd love to feel your hand touching mine
And tell me w[D]hy I must keep working on
Yes I'd gi[C]ve my life to lay my head tonight
On a be[G]d of California stars

[G] [D][C][G]

I'd like to dream my troubles all away
On a be[D]d of California stars
[C]Jump up from my star bed make another day
Undern[G]eath my California stars

They hang like grapes on vines that shine
And warm a lov[D]er's glass like a friendly wine
So I'd gi[C]ve this world to dream a dream with you
On our b[G]ed of California stars

[G] [D][C][G]

I'd like to rest my heavy head tonight
On a be[D]d of California stars
I'd like to la[C]y my weary bones tonight
On a be[G]d of California stars

I'd love to feel your hand touching mine
And tell me w[D]hy I must keep working on
Yes I'd gi[C]ve my life to lay my head tonight
On a be[G]d of California stars

[G] [D][C][G]

I'd like to dream my troubles all away
On a be[D]d of California stars
[C]Jump up from my star bed make another day
Undern[G]eath my California stars

They hang like grapes on vines that shine
And warm a lov[D]er's glass like a friendly wine
So I'd gi[C]ve this world to dream a dream with you
On our b[G]ed of California stars

[G]    [D]      [C]     [G]D
Dream a dream with you
So I'd g[C]ive my life to lay my head to night
On a b[G]ed of California stars.
