Queen Of Hearts chords

[A][G][D][A][D][G][G][A][D][G][A][D]

[D]Midnight, and I'm awaiting on the 12:05,
hoping it'll take me just a little farther down the [G]line
[D]Moonlight, you're just a heartache in disguise;
won't you keep my heart from breaking if it's only for a very short [G]time?

[A]Playing with the [G]queen of [D]hearts, [A]knowing it ain't [D]really [G]smart
The joker ain't the [A]only [D]fool, who'll [G]do any[A]thing for [D]you
[A]Laying out a[G]nother [D]lie, [A]thinking about a [D]life of [G]crime;
that's what I'll [A]have to [D]do, to [G]keep me a[A]way from [D]you

[D]Honey, you know it makes you mad;
why is everybody telling everybody what you have [G]done?
[D]Baby, I know it makes you sad,
but when they're handing out the heartaches you know you got to have you [G]some

[A]Playing with the [G]queen of [D]hearts, [A]knowing it ain't [D]really [G]smart
The joker ain't the [A]only [D]fool, who'll [G]do any[A]thing for [D]you
[A]Laying out a[G]nother [D]lie, [A]thinking 'bout a [D]life of [G]crime;
that's what I'll [A]have to [D]do, to [G]keep me a[A]way from [D]you

[B][A][E][B][E][A][A][B][E][A][B][E][A][B][E]

[D]Lovers, I know you've had a few
But hide your heart beneath the covers and tell 'em they're the only [G]one
And [D]others, they know just what I'm going through
And it's a-hard to be a lover when you say you're only in it for [G]fun

[A]Playing with the [G]queen of [D]hearts, [A]knowing it ain't [D]really [G]smart
The joker ain't the [A]only [D]fool, who'll [G]do any[A]thing for [D]you

[B]Playing with the [A]queen of [E]hearts, and [B]knowing it ain't [E]really [A]smart;
the joker ain't the [B]only [E]fool, who'll [A]do any[B]thing for [E]you
[B]Laying out a[A]nother [E]lie, [B]thinking 'bout a [E]life of [A]crime
That's what I'll [B]have to [E]do, to [A]keep me a[B]way from [E]you
