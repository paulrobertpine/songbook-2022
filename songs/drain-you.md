[A]  One ba[C#]by [F#]to ano[B]ther [A]says I'm lu[C#]cky to hav[F#]e met you[B]...
[A]I don't [C#]care [F#]what you [B]think un[A]less it is[C#] about me[F#]
It is now my duty to completely drain you
I travel through a tube and end up in your infection

[E]   [D]  Chew [B]your meat for you.
[D]Pass it   [B]back and forth
In a      passionate kiss
From my   mouth to yours,
[A]I [G]like [F#]you...

[A]  With [C#]eyes [F#]so dil[B]ated[A], I've b[C#]ecome y[F#]our pup[B]il
[A] You've [C#]taugh[F#]t me ever[B]ything W[A]ithout a p[C#]oison a[F#]pple

The water is so yellow, I'm a healthy student
Indebted and so grateful - Vacuum out the fluids

[E]   [D]  Chew [B]your meat for you.
[D]Pass it   [B]back and forth
In a      passionate kiss
From my   mouth to yours,
[A]I [G]like [F#]you...
