          A
The other night dear as I lay sleeping
            D              A
I dreamed I held you in my arms
       D                 A
When I awoke dear I was mistaken
      A       E          A
So I bowed my head and I cried

           A
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
            D                    A
You make me happy when skies are gray
             D                     A
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
             A        E        A 
Please don't take my sunshine away

            A
I've always loved you and made you happy
             D                 A
and nothing else could come between
               D               A
but now you've left me to love another
         A          E        A
you have shattered all of my dreams

           A
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
            D                    A
You make me happy when skies are gray
             D                     A
You'll never know dear, how much I love you
             A        E        A 
Please don't take my sunshine away
