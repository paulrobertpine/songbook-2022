G
I got a pig, home in a pen
                 C
Corn to feed him on
G
All I need is a pretty little girl
    D                 G
To feed him when I'm gone

Dark clouds are rising
Sure sign of rain
Get your old gray bonnet on
Sweet little Liza Jane

chorus

Bake 'em biscuits, baby
Bake 'em good and brown
When you get them biscuits baked
We're Alabama bound

chorus

Goin' on a mountain
To sow a little cane
Raise a barrel of Sorghum
Sweet little Liza Jane

chorus x2
