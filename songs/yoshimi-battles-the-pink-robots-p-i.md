Verse
C              Em     F                         G
  Her name is Yoshimi - she's a black belt in karate
C                 Em   F                           G

Pre-chorus
          Fmaj7             G            C          Cmaj9/B   F
Cause she knows that it's demanding to defeat those  evil  machines
Fmaj7                G

Verse
C              Em     F                         G
  Those evil natured robots - they're programmed to destroy us
C                 Em   F                           G

Fmaj7                G
      I know she can beat them
Chorus
     C                    Em             Dm                  F        G
