Capo on 3 

[Verse 1]

[Am]Travelling north, travelling nor[F]th to f[E]ind you
[Am]Train wheels beating, the wind i[F]n my eyes[E]
[Am]Don't even know what I'll find wh[F]en I get to you[E]
[Am7]Call out your nam[F]e love, don't be surpr[Am]ised

It's [Dm]so many miles and so long s[Am]ince I've left[F] you[E]
[Dm]Don't even know what I'll find [Am]when I get to you
[F]But suddenly now,[G]I know where I belong
It's many[C] hundred miles a[G]nd it won[F]'t      [Dm]       be[Am]long

[Am]
[Am]-[Am6] [Am6]-[Am] 
x4

[Verse 2]

[Am]Nothing at all, in my he[F]ad, to [E]say to you
[Am]Only the beat of the tra[F]in I'm [E]on
[Am]Nothing I've learned all my life[F] on the[E]way to you
[Am7]One day our love[F] was ov[E]er and gone[Am]

[Chorus]

It's [Dm]so many miles and so long s[Am]ince I've left[F] you[E]
[Dm]Don't even know what I'll find [Am]when I get to you
[F]But suddenly now,[G]I know where I belong
It's many[C] hundred miles a[G]nd it won[F]'t      [Dm]       be[Am]long

[Am]
[Am]-[Am6] [Am6]-[Am] 
x4

[Verse 3]

[Am]What will I do if there's someon[F]e there with you[E]
[Am]Maybe someone you've al[F]ways known[E]
[Am]How do I know I can come a[F]nd give to [E]you
[Am7]Love with no war[F]ning and find yo[E]u alone[Am]

[Chorus]

It's [Dm]so many miles and so long s[Am]ince I've left[F] you[E]
[Dm]Don't even know what I'll find [Am]when I get to you
[F]But suddenly now,[G]I know where I belong
It's many[C] hundred miles a[G]nd it won[F]'t      [Dm]       be[Am]long

It w[Dm]on't be lon[Am]g
It w[Dm]on't be lon[Am]g
It w[Dm]on't b[E]e lon[Am]g
