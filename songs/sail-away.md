[G] [Am] [D] [G]

 [G]I could live inside a [Am]teepee
 [D]I could die in penthouse [G]thirty-five
 [G]You could lose me on the [Am]freeway
 [D]But I would still make it[G]back alive

 [D]As long as we can sail [G]away
 [D]As long as we can sail [C]away[D]-aaa
 There'll be [G]wind in the canyon
 [Am]Moon on the rise
 [C]As long as [D]we can sail a[G]way

 [G]See the losers in the bes[Am]t bars
 [D]Meet the winners in the [G]dives
 [G]Where the people are the [Am]real stars
 [D]All the rest of their [G]lives

 [D]As long as we can sail [G]away
 [D]As long as we can sail [C]away [D]-aaa
 There'll be [G]wind in the canyon
 [Am]Moon on the rise
 [C]As long as [D]we can sail a[G]way

 [G]There's a road stretched out betwee[Am]n us
 [D]Like a ribbon on the [G]high plain
 [G]Down from Phoenix through [Am]Salinas
 [D]'Round the bend and back [G]again

 [D]As long as we can sail [G]away
 [D]As long as we can sail aw[C]ay -[D]aaa
 There'll be [G]wind in the canyon
 [Am]Moon on the rise
 [C]As long as [D]we can sail a[G]way
