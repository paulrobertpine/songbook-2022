[C]Standing on the corner with a nickel or a [F]dime
[F]There use to be a [C]rail car to take you do[C/B]wn the [Am]line
[C]Too much beer and whiskey to ever be em[F]ployed
[F]And when I got to [C]Nashville, it was too much sol[C/B]diers [Am]joy
[C]Wasted on the wayside, wasted on the [F]way
[F]If I don’t go to[C]morrow, you know I’m [C/B]gone [Am]today

[C]Back babe, back in [F]time
I wanna go [C]back when you were [Am]mine
[C]Back babe, back in [F]time
I wanna go [Am]back[G] when you were [C]mine

[Em]Black highway all night [F]ride
Watching the [Am]times fal[G]l away to the [F]side
[Em]Clear channel way down [F]low
Is comin’ in [Am]loud [G]and my mind let [F]go

[C]Peaches in the summertime, apples in the [F]fall
[F]If I can’t have you [C]all the time, I won’t have [C/B]none at [Am]all
[C]Oh, I wish I was in Frisco in a brand new pair of [F]shoes
[F]I’m sittin’ here in [C]Nashville with Norman’s N[C/B]ashville [Am]blues
So come [C]all you good time rounders listenin’ to my [F]sound
[F]And then drink a round to Na[C]shville before the[C/B]y tear it [Am]down

[C]Back babe, back in [F]time
I wanna go [C]back when you were [Am]mine
[C]Back babe, back in [F]time
I wanna go [Am]back wh[G]en you were [C]mine

[Em]Hard weather, drivin’ [F]slow
Buggies and the [Am]hats [G]in town for the [F]show
[Em]Oh darlin, the songs they [F]played
All I got [Am]left[G] of lovin’ [F]me

[C]Back babe, back in [F]time
I wanna go [C]back when you were [Am]mine
[C]Back babe, back in [F]time
I wanna go b[Am]ack [G]when you were [C]mine
