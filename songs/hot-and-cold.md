[G]You change your m[D]ind
Like a g[Am]irl changes clot[C]hes
Yeah y[G]ou, PMS[D]
Like a bi[Am]tch
I would k[C]now
And y[G]ou over-th[D]ink
Always sp[Am]eak
Critical[C]ly
I should k[G]now
That you[D]'re no good for m[Am]e [C]

Cause you're h[G]ot then you're cold
You're y[D]es then you're no
You're i[Am]n then you're out
You're u[C]p then you're down
You're w[G]rong when it's right
It's bla[D]ck and it's white
We fig[Am]ht, we break up
We kis[C]s, we make up

([G]you) You don't really want to s[D]tay, no
[Am](but you) But you don't really want to go[C]-o
You're h[G]ot then you're cold
You're y[D]es then you're no
You're i[Am]n then you're out
You're u[C]p then you're down

[G][D][Am][C]

[G]We used to [D]be
Just like tw[Am]ins, so in sy[C]nc
The sa[G]me ener[D]gy
now's a d[Am]ead battery[C]
Used to l[G]augh, 'bout nothin[D]g
Now you're pl[Am]ain borin[C]g
I should k[G]now
That you[D]'re not gonna cha[Am]nge [C]

Cause you're h[G]ot then you're cold
You're y[D]es then you're no
You're i[Am]n then you're out
You're u[C]p then you're down
You're w[G]rong when it's right
It's bla[D]ck and it's white
We fig[Am]ht, we break up
We kis[C]s, we make up

([G]you) You don't really want to s[D]tay, no
[Am](but you) But you don't really want to go[C]-o
You're h[G]ot then you're cold
You're y[D]es then you're no
You're i[Am]n then you're out
You're u[C]p then you're down

[Em] [C] [G] [D]
[Em] [C] [G] [D]

[Em] Someone[C]call the doctor
[G] Got a case of a [D]love bi-polar
[Em] Stuck on a[C]roller coaster
[G]Can't get off this [D]ride

[G]You change your m[D]ind
Like a g[Am]irl changes clot[C]hes

Cause you're h[G]ot then you're cold
You're y[D]es then you're no
You're i[Am]n then you're out
You're u[C]p then you're down
You're w[G]rong when it's right
It's bla[D]ck and it's white
We fig[Am]ht, we break up
We kis[C]s, we make up

Cause you're h[G]ot then you're cold
You're y[D]es then you're no
You're i[Am]n then you're out
You're u[C]p then you're down
You're w[G]rong when it's right
It's bla[D]ck and it's white
We fig[Am]ht, we break up
We kis[C]s, we make up

([G]you) You don't really want to s[D]tay, no
[Am](but you) But you don't really want to go[C]-o
You're h[G]ot then you're cold
You're y[D]es then you're no
You're i[Am]n then you're out
You're u[C]p then you're down [G]
