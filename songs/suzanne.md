Su[E]zanne takes you down to her place near the river
You can [F#m]hear the boats go by, you can spend the night beside her
And you [E]know that she's half-crazy, but that's why you wanna be there
And she [G#m]feeds you tea and oranges that come [A]all the way from China
And just[E] when you mean to tell her that you [F#m]have no love to give her
Then she [E]gets you on her wavelength, and she [F#m]lets the river answer
That you've [E]always been her lover

And you [G#m]want to travel with her, and you [A]want to travel blind
And you [E]know she will trust you for you've [F#m]touched her perfect body
With your [E]mind

And [E]Jesus was a sailor when he walked upon the water
And he [F#m]spent a long time watching from his lonely wooden tower
And [E]when he knew for certain only drowning men could see him
He said: "[G#m]All men will be sailors then un[A]til the sea shall free them"
But [E]he himself was broken long be[F#m]fore the sky would open
For[E]saken, almost human, he [F#m]sank beneath your wisdom
Like a [E]stone

And you [G#m]want to travel with him, and you [A]want to travel blind
And you [E]think maybe you'll trust him for he's [F#m]touched your perfect body
With his [E]mind

Now Su[E]zanne takes your hand, and she leads you to the river
She is [F#m]wearing rags and feathers from the Salvation Army counter
And the [E]sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of the Harbour
And she [G#m]shows you where to look among the [A]garbage and the flowers
There are[E] heroes in the seaweed, there are [F#m]children in the morning
They are [E]leaning out for love, and they will [F#m]lean that way forever
While Su[E]zanne holds the mirror

And you [G#m]want to travel with her, and you [A]want to travel blind
And you [E]know that you can trust her for she's [F#m]touched your perfect body
With her [E]mind
