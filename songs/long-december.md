A [G]long [D]December [A] and there's reason to  [Em]believe                             
Maybe [G] this year will be [D] better than the  [G]last   [G]                          
I [Em] can't  [G] remember the [D]last thing that you [A]said        
as you were [Em]leavin'               
Now the [D]days go by so [G]fast [G]
                             
And it's [D] one more day up [G]in the [Em]canyons[G]                            
And it's [D]one more night in [G]Hollywood [Em]    [Em]                                  
If you [D] think that I could [G]be forgiven[Em]...I wish you  [D]would
  [G]   [Em]  [G]  [D]   [G]   [Em]   [Em]
nanananananananana..
          
The [G]smell of [D]hospitals in [A]winter                                 
And the [Em]feeling that it's [G]all a lot of [D] oysters, but no [G] pearls  [G]   
[Em] All at [G]  once you look [D]across a [A]crowded room    
To see the [Em]way that light [D]attaches to a [G]girl

And it's [D] one more day up [G]in the [Em]canyons[G]                            
And it's [D]one more night in [G]Hollywood [Em]    [Em]        
If you [D] think you might come to [G]California..[Em].I think you [D]should
  [G]   [Em]  [G]   [D]   [G]   [Em]
nanananananananana..
       
[G] Drove up to the [D]Hillside Manor [A]sometime after [Em]two a.m.                    
And [G]talked a little [D]while about the [G]year                    
[Em]I guess the [G]winter makes you [D] laugh a little [A]slower  
Makes you [Em]talk a little [D]lower about
the [G]things you could not show her [G]
                                           
And it's been a [G]long [D] December and there's [A]reason to [Em]believe       
Maybe [G] this year will be [D] better than the [G]last   [G]                    
I [Em] can't remember [G]all the  [D]times I tried to [A]tell myself
To [Em]hold on to these [D]  moments as they [G]pass [G]

And it's [D] one more day up [G]in the [Em]canyons[G]                            
And it's [D]one more night in [G]Hollywood [Em]    [Em]  
It's been [D] so long since I've [G] seen the [Em]ocean...I guess I [D]should
  [G]   [Em]  [G]   [D]   [G]   [Em]   [Em]
nanananananananana.... (Repeat)
