I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
            C                         G
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
                   D                           C
And I'm not proud of my address - in the torn up town
             G
No postcode envy

D
But every song's like: gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom

Blood stains, ballgowns, trashin' the hotel room
C                                           G
We don't care - we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
                                D
But everybody's like Cristal, Mayback, diamonds on your timepiece

Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
C                                      G
We don't care - we  aren't caught up in your love affair

                          D
And we'll never be royals - It don't run in our blood
                 C
That kind of lux just ain't for us
                 G
We crave a different kind of buzz
                      D
Let me be your ruler - you can call me Queen Bee
                  C
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
G                  D
Let me live that fantasy

My friends and I we've cracked the code
                  C                     G
We count our dollars on the train to the party
              D                                      C
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
                    G
We didn't come from money

D
But every song's like: gold teeth, grey goose, trippin' in the bathroom

Blood stains, ballgowns, trashin' the hotel room
C                                           G
We don't care - we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
                                D
But everybody's like Cristal, Mayback, diamonds on your timepiece

Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
C                                      G
We don't care - we  aren't caught up in your love affair

                           D
And we'll never be royals - It don't run in our blood
                 C
That kind of lux just ain't for us
                 G

                      D

                  C
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
G                 D
Let me live that fantasy

D
oh ooh oh ohh
         C
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
               G
And I'm in love with being queen
D
oh ooh oh ohh
C
Life's a game without a care
              G
We aren't caught up in your love affair

                          D
And we'll never be royals - It don't run in our blood
                 C

                 G

                      D

                  C
And baby I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule
G                            D
