Em                            Cmaj7/G
Shout, Shout, let it all out. These are the things I can do without
     Asus2                        Em
Come on, I'm talking to you, come on
Em                            Cmaj7/G

G                                        Asus2
In violent times, you shouldn't have to sell your soul
G                                        Asus2
In black and white, they really really ought to know
G                                        Asus2
Those one track minds that took you for a working boy
G                                        Asus2
Kiss them goodbye, you shouldn't have to jump for joy (You shouldn't have to...)
 
Em                            Cmaj7/G
Shout, Shout, let it all out. These are the things I can do without

G                                        Asus2
They gave you life and in return you gave them them hell
G                                        Asus2
As cold as ice, I hope we live to tell the tale (I hope we live to...)

And when you've taken down your guard
G                                               Asus2
If I could change your mind, I'd really love to break your heart (I'd really love to...)
