[D][a]

When I [A]call you [B7]up, your l[D]ine's enga[A]ged.
I have [A]had en[B7]ough, so a[D]ct your a[A]ge!
We have l[A7]ost the t[D]ime that [Dm]was so hard to f[A]ind,
And I will [A]lose my [B7]mind if y[D]ou w[A]on't see me. (You won't see me)
[D]You wo[A]n't see me. (You won't see me)

I don't k[A]now why y[B7]ou should w[D]ant to h[A]ide
But I c[A]an't get th[B7]rough, my h[D]ands are t[A]ied.
I won't w[A7]ant to st[D]ay, I d[Dm]on't have much to s[A]ay,
but I can t[A]urn a[B7]way, and y[D]ou w[A]on't see me. (You won't see me)
Y[D]ou wo[A]n't see me. (You won't see me)

[D6]Time after t[Dm6]ime you refuse to even lis[A]ten.
[B7]I wouldn't mind if I [E7sus4]knew what I was mis[E7]sing.
(No I wouldn't no I wouldn't)

Though the d[A]ays are f[B7]ew they're fi[D]lled with te[A]ars,
and since [A]I lost y[B7]ou it fe[D]els like y[A]ears.
Yes, it s[A7]eems so l[D]ong, g[Dm]irl since you've been g[A]one,
and I just c[A]an't go [B7]on if y[D]ou wo[A]n't see me. (You won't see me)
Y[D]ou wo[A]n't see me. (You won't see me)

[D6]Time after t[Dm6]ime you refuse to even lis[A]ten.
[B7]I wouldn't mind if I [E7sus4]knew what I was mis[E7]sing.

Yes, it s[A7]eems so lo[D]ng, gi[Dm]rl since you've been go[A]ne,
and I just c[A]an't go [B7]on if y[D]ou wo[A]n't see me. (You won't see me)
Y[D]ou wo[A]n't see me. (You won't see me)

[A]Ooh [B7]ooh la la la o[D]oh o[A]oh la la la (repeat and fade)
