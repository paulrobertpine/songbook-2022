[Am]We lease twenty acres and [F]one Ginny mule
[E7]From the Alabama [Am]trust
[Am]For half of the cotton and a [F]third of the corn
[E7]We get a handful of [Am]dust

We c[F]annot have all things to [C]please us, no [G]matter how we [Am]try
Until we've [F]all gone to [C]Jesus, we can o[G]nly wonder w[Am]hy[F][G][Am]

[Am]I had a daughter [F]called her Annabelle
[E7]She's the apple of my [Am]eye
[Am]Tried to give her something [F]like I never had
[E7]Didn't want to ever hear her [Am]cry

We c[F]annot have all things to [C]please us, no [G]matter how we [Am]try
Until we've [F]all gone to [C]Jesus, we can o[G]nly wonder w[Am]hy

[F]     [C]    [G]    [Am]
[F]     [C]    [G]    [Am]  [F]  [G]  [Am]

[Am]When I'm dead and buried I'll take a [F]hard life of tears
[E7]From every day I've ever [Am]known
[Am]Anna's in the churchyard she got [F]no life at all
[E7]She only got these words on a [Am]stone

We c[F]annot have all things to [C]please us, no [G]matter how we [Am]try
Until we've [F]all gone to [C]Jesus, we can o[G]nly wonder w[Am]hy

[F]     [C]    [G]    [Am]
[F]     [C]    [G]    [Am]  [F]  [G]  [Am]
