[Intro]
|[Dm]   |[C]   |[G]   |[G]   |

[Verse 1]
Do you re[Dm]member me, back when you were [C]young?
The night we met at the [G]boathouse
I was hoping you [G]noticed me
And I [Dm]still believe[C] in another life we were [G]meant to be
Like two birds on a [G]desert tree

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we could [Dm]all get a little high if we want
We could [C]all get a little high if we want, come [G]on
Ah, come o[G]n

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm [Dm]running scar[C]ed
Hey, and I'm [G]running scar[G]ed
Oh, I'm [Dm]running scar[C]ed
And I'm [G]running scar[G]ed
Oh, [Dm]don't look back
[C]Don't look back, hey, [G]hey
[G]  Oh, [Dm]don't look back
[C]Don't look back, hey, hey, he[G]y[G]

[Verse 2]
'Cause I'm [Dm]borderline[C], mentally unst[G]able
Sweep it under the [G]table, yeah
And these [Dm]bedouin eyes
[C]  We were meant to be in a [G]different time
Everything is a [G]warning sign

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we could [Dm]all get a little high if we want
We could [C]all get a little high if we want, come [G]on
Ah, come o[G]n

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm [Dm]running scar[C]ed
Hey, and I'm [G]running scar[G]ed
Oh, I'm [Dm]running scar[C]ed
And I'm [G]running scar[G]ed
Oh, [Dm]don't look back
[C]Don't look back, hey, [G]hey
[G]  Oh, [Dm]don't look back
[C]Don't look back, hey, hey, he[G]y[G]

[Instrumental]
|[Dm]   |[C]   |[G]   |[G]   |

[Bridge]
'Cause we could [Dm]all get a little high if we want
We [C]could all get a little high if we want, [G]come on
Yeah[G], [Dm]we can all live a better life if we want
[C]We can all live a better life if we want, [G]come on[G]
'Cause [Dm]we could all get a little high if we want
[C]We could all get a little high if we want[G]

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm [Dm]running scar[C]ed
Hey, and I'm [G]running scar[G]ed
Oh, I'm [Dm]running scar[C]ed
And I'm [G]running scar[G]ed
'Cause I'm [Dm]running scar[C]ed
Hey, and I'm [G]running scar[G]ed
Oh, I'm [Dm]running scar[C]ed
And I'm [G]running scar[G]ed
