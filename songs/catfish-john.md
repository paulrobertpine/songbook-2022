[D]Mama said don't go [G]near that river
[D]Don't be hangin' around old Catfish[A]John
[D]Come the morning I'd [G]always be there
[D]Walking in his footsteps in [A]sweet delta [D]dawn

Take me [G]back to another [D]morning,
to a [G]time so long [D]ago,
Where the [G]sweet magnolia [D]blossomed,
cotton [D]fields[A] as white as [D]snow.

[D]Mama said don't go [G]near that river
[D]Don't be hangin' around old Catfish[A]John
[D]Come the morning I'd [G]always be there
[D]Walking in his footsteps in [A]sweet delta [D]dawn

Catfish [G]John was a river [D]hobo
lived and [G]died by the river's [D]bend,
Looking [G]back I still [D]remember
I was [D]proud[A] to be his [D]friend

[D]Mama said don't go [G]near that river
[D]Don't be hangin' around old Catfish[A]John
[D]Come the morning I'd [G]always be there
[D]Walking in his footsteps in [A]sweet delta [D]dawn

(solos on verse)

Born a [G]slave in the town of [D]Vicksburg,
traded [G]for a chestnut [D]mare,
Lord he [G]never spoke in [D]anger
though his [D]load[A] was hard to [D]bear.

[D]Mama said don't go [G]near that river
[D]Don't be hangin' around old Catfish[A]John
[D]Come the morning I'd [G]always be there
[D]Walking in his footsteps in [A]sweet delta [D]dawn

(solos on verse)

(chorus)
[D]Walking in his footsteps in [A]sweet delta [D]dawn
