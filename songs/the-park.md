Why would he come back through the park?
                     D                   G
You thought that you saw him but no you did not
                   C                      G
It's not him who'd come across the sea to surprise you
                  D                    G
Not him who would know where in London to find you

                C              G
With sadness so real that it populates
             D                 G
The city and leaves you homeless again
               C                G
Steam from the cup and snow on the path
                 D
The seasons have changed from present to

G Em C
past
    G Em C
The past
    G Em C
The past
      G Em C
Turns whole to half
    G Em C
The past

Why would he come back through the park?
                     D                   G
You thought that you saw him but no you did not
           C             G
Who can be sure of anything through
                  D                       G
The distance that keeps you from knowing the truth
              C                 G
Why would you think your boy could become
                  D
The man who could make you sure he was
    G Em C
the one?
    G Em C
The one
   G Em C
My one
   G Em C
My one
G
