[Em]"The problem is [D]all inside your[Cmaj7] head", she said to [B7]me,
[Em7]The answer is ea[D]sy if you [Cmaj7]take it logic[Ebdim]ally.
[Em7]I'd like to h[D]elp you in your s[Cmaj7]truggle to be f[B7]ree.
There must be [Em]fifty w[Am7]ays to leave your l[Em]over."[Em]

[Em]She said: "It's r[D]eally not my [Cmaj7]habit to intr[B7]ude,
Furthermo[Em]re I hope my m[D]eaning won't be[Cmaj7] lost or miss-con[Ebdim]strued,
But I'll r[Em]epeat myself,[D] at the r[Cmaj7]isk of being cr[B7]ude.
There must be [Em]- fifty w[Am7]ays to leave your l[Em]over, [Em]
[Em]Fifty w[Am7]ays to leave your l[Em]over."

Just slip out the b[G]ack Jack, make a new p[Bb]lan Stan,
No need to be [C7]coy Roy, just get yourself f[G]ree
Hop on the b[G]us Gus, you don't need to disc[Bb]uss much,
Just drop off the [C7]key Lee, and get yourself f[G]ree.

Slip out the ba[G]ck Jack, make a new p[Bb]lan Stan,
You don't need to be [C7]coy Roy, you just listen to [G]me.
Hop on the b[G]us Gus, you don't need to dis[Bb]cuss much,
Just drop off the [C7]key Lee, and get yourself fr[G]ee.

[Em]She said: "It gr[D]ieves me so to[Cmaj7] see you in such p[B7]ain.
I wish there wa[Em]s something I could [D]do to make y[Cmaj7]ou smile [Ebdim]again."
I said: "I app[Em]reciate that[D] and would you p[Cmaj7]lease expla[B7]in
About the [Em]- fifty [Am7]ways."[Em]

[Em]She said: "Why d[D]on't we both just s[Cmaj7]leep on it toni[B7]ght,
And I bel[Em]ieve that in the m[D]orning you'll [Cmaj7]begin to see the [Ebdim]light."

Then she k[Em]issed me and I r[D]ealised, she p[Cmaj7]robably was r[B7]ight,
There must be[Em] fifty w[Am7]ays to leave your l[Em]over,
[Em]   Fifty w[Am7]ays to leave your l[Em]over.

Just slip out the b[G]ack Jack, make a new p[Bb]lan Stan,
You don't need to be [C7]coy Roy, and get yourself fr[G]ee.
Hop on the b[G]us Gus, you don't need to disc[Bb]uss much.
Just drop off the [C7]key Lee, and set yourself fr[G]ee.
