[Am]Hello darkness, my old [G]friend,
I've come to talk with you [Am]again,
Because a vision soft[F]ly creep-[C]ing,
Left its seeds while I [F]was slee-[C]ping,
And the [F]vision that was planted in my [C]brain
Still remains[Am]
[C]Within the [G]sound of [Am]silence


In restless dreams I walked a-[G]lone
Narrow streets of cobble-[Am]stone,
'neath the halo of [F]a street [C]lamp,
I turned my collar to the [F]cold and [C]damp
When my [F]eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon [C]light
That split the night[Am]
[C]And touched the [G]sound of [Am]silence


And in the naked light I [G]saw
Ten thousand people, maybe [Am]more
People talking with-[F]out spea-[C]king,
People hearing with-[F]out liste-[C]ning,
People writing [F]songs that voices never [C]share
And no one dare[Am]
[C]Disturb the [G]sound of [Am]silence


Fools said I, you do not [G]know
Silence like a cancer [Am]grows
Hear my words that I [F]might teach [C]you,
Take my arms that I [F]might reach [C]you
But my [F]words like silent raindrops [C]fell,[Am]
And [C]echoed
In the [G]wells of [Am]silence


And the people bowed and [G]prayed
To the neon God they [Am]made
And the sign flashed out [F]its war-[C]ning,
In the words that it [F]was for-[C]ming
And the sign said, the [F]words of the prophets
Are written on the subway [C]walls
And tenement [C]halls[Am]
And whisp-[C]er'd in the [G]sounds of [Am]silence
