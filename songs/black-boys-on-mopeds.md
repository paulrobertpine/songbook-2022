[G]Margaret That[D]cher on T[C]V
Shocked by the [G]deaths that took [D]place in Bei[C]jing
Seems [G]strange that she [D]should be of[C]fended
The same [G]orders are [D]given by [C]her

[G]I've said [D]this before [C]now
You said I was [G]childish and [D]you'll say it [C]now
[G]Remem[D]ber what I [C]told you
If t[G]hey hated [D]me, they will [C]hate you

England's not the [G]mythical [D]land of [C]Madame George and roses
It's the [G]home of [D]police who kill [C]black boys on mopeds
And I[G] love my [D]boy, and [C]that's why I'm leaving
I don't w[G]ant him to be aw[D]are that there's a[C]ny such thing as grieving

[G]Young mother [D]down at Smith [C]Field, 5 a.m.
[G]Looking for [D]food for her [C]kids
In her [G]arms she holds [D]three cold [C]babies
And the [G]first word that [D]they learned was "[C]Please"

[G]These are [D]dangerous [C]days
To say what you [G]feel is to [D]dig your own g[C]rave
[G]Remem[D]ber what I [C]told you
If you [G]were of the [D]world they would [C]love you

England's not the [G]mythical [D]land of [C]Madame George and roses
It's the [G]home of [D]police who kill [C]black boys on mopeds
And I[G] love my [D]boy, and [C]that's why I'm leaving
I don't w[G]ant him to be aw[D]are that there's a[C]ny such thing as grieving
