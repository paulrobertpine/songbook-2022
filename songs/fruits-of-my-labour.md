Capo 1

Baby, [G]see how I been living
Velvet [Am]curtains on the windows [C]to
Keep the [G]bright and unforgiving
Lig[Am]ht from shining thr[C]ough
Baby, [G]I remember all the things[C]we did
When [G]we slept together and the blue [C]behind your eyelids
[Am]Baby, sweet [C]baby

Traced your sc[G]ent through the gloom
'Til I fo[Am]und these purple flow[C]ers
I was sp[G]ent, I was soon
Sme[Am]lling you for hou[C]rs
[G]Lavender, l[C]otus blossoms too
[G]Water the dirt, [C]flowers last for you
[Am]Baby, [C]sweet baby

Tangerine[G]s and persimmons
And [Am]sugarcane[C]
Grapes[G]and honeydew melon
Enough[Am] fit for a quee[C]n
Le[G]mon trees don't make[C]a sound
'Til [G]branches bend and fruit f[C]alls to the ground
[Am]Baby, s[C]weet baby

solo time!

Come to [G]my world and witness
The [Am]way things have c[C]hanged
'Cause I[G]finally did it, baby
I [Am]got out of La Gran[C]ge
Got in [G]my Mercury and [C]drove out west
Pedal t[G]o the metal and my [C]luck to the test
[Am]Baby, [C]sweet baby

I been [G]tryin' to enjoy
All the[Am] fruits of my labo[C]r
I been [G]cryin' for you boy
But [Am]truth is my savi[C]or
Baby, [G]sweet baby if it's [C]all the same
Take the[G] glory any day ov[C]er the fame
[Am]Baby, [C]sweet baby
