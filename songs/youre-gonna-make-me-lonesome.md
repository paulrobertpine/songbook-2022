Capo 4

[C]I've seen lo[Cmaj7]ve go by my door
[F]It's never been this close before
[C]Never been [Cmaj7]so easy or so [G7]slow
[C]Been shootin' in[Cmaj7]the dark too long
[F]If something's not right it's wrong
[C]You're gonna make me [G]lonesome when you [C]go

[C]Dragon cloud[Cmaj7]s so high above
[F]I've only known careless love
[C]It always ha[Cmaj7]s hit me from [G7]below
[C]But this time [Cmaj7]it's more correct
[F]Right on target so direct
[C]You're gonna make me [G]lonesome when you [C]go

[C]Purple clover[Cmaj7]Queen Anne lace
[F]Crimson hair across your face
[C]You can make [Cmaj7]me cry if you don't [G7]know
[C]Can't remember [Cmaj7]what I was thinking of
[F]You might be spoiling me too much love
[C]You're gonna make me [G]lonesome when you [C]go

[G]Flowers on the hillside blooming [C]crazy
[G]Crickets talking back and forth in [C]rhyme
[D7]Blue river running slow and lazy
[F]I could spend forever with you and [G]never realise the time

[C]Situations h[Cmaj7]ave ended sad
[F]Relationships have all been bad
[C]Mine have bee[Cmaj7]n like Verlaine's and [G7]Rimbaud
[C]But thereâ€™s no way [Cmaj7]I can compare
[F]All those scenes to this affair
[C]You're gonna make me [G]lonesome when you [C]go

[G]You're gonna make me wonder what I'm [C]doing
[G]Staying far behind without [C]you
[D7]You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
[F]You're gonna make me give myself [G]a good talking to

[C]I'll look fo[Cmaj7]r you in old Honolula
[F]San Francisco, Ashtabula
[C]You're gonna [Cmaj7]have to leave me now I[G7]know
[C]But I'll see[Cmaj7]you in the sky above
[F]In the tall grass in the ones I love
[C]You're gonna make me [G]lonesome when you [C]go
