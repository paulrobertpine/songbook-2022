[D] [G][Bm][A][C]

I want to [D]run
[D]I want to hide
[D]I want to tear down the walls
That hold me in[G]side
I want to reach [Bm]out
And touch the [A]flame
Where the [C]streets have no name
I, I, I, I want to [D]feel,
[D]sunlight on my face
[D]I see the dust cloud disappear
without a [G]trace
I want to take [Bm]shelter
from the poison [A]rain

Where the s[C]treets have no name, oh ah
Where the streets have no [D]name
[D]Where the streets have no name

We’re still building
Then [G]burning down love, burning down love
And when I g[Bm]o there
I go there [A]with you...
(it’s all I can [D]do)

[D]The city’s a flood
[D]And our love turns to rust
[D]We’re beaten and blown by the wind
Trampled in[G]dust
I’ll show you a [Bm]place
High on a desert[A]plain
Where the [C]streets have no name, oh ah

Where the streets have no [D]name
[D]Where the streets have no name

We’re still building
Then [G]burning down love, burning down love
And when I g[Bm]o there
I go there [A]with you...
(it’s all I can [D]do)

[D]Our love turns to rust
[D]We’re beaten and [G]blown by the wind, blown by the wind
Oh, and I [D]see love, see our love turn to rust
Ah [D]we’re beaten and [G]blown by the wind, blown by the wind
Oh when I [Bm]go there, I go there [A]with you
It’s all I can [D]do
