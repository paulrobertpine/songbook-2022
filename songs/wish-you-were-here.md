C                         D/F#
So, so you think you can tell,
             Am/E                   G
Heaven from Hell, blue skies from pain.
                     D/F#                      C                    Am
Can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail, a smile from a veil,
                      G
Do you think you can tell?
 
                      C                   D/F#
Did they get you to trade your heroes for ghosts,
                Am/E                  G                             D/F#
Hot ashes for trees, hot air for a cool breeze, cold comfort for change,
                  C                        Am                         G
And did you exchange a walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?

C                               D/F#
How I wish, how I wish you were here.
           Am/E                                    G
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl, year after year,
D/F#                               C
 Running over the same old ground. What have we found?
             Am                         G
The same old fears. Wish you were here!
