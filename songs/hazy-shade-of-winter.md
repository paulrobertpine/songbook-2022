[Dm]Time, time, time, see what's be[C]come of me
While I[Bb]looked around
For my possi[Am]bilities
I was so [C]hard to please

But look a[Dm]round, leaves are [C]brown
And the [Bb]sky is a h[A7]azy shade of w[Dm]inter

Hear the salvation [C]army band
[Bb]Down by the riverside, it's bound to be a better ride
Than [Am]what you've got planned
Carry your [C]cup in your hand

And look a[Dm]round you, leaves are [C]brown now
And the [Bb]sky is a h[A7]azy shade of w[Dm]inter

Hang on to your [C]hopes, my friend
[Bb]That's an easy thing to say, but if your hopes should pass away
Then [Am]simply pretend
That you can [C]build them again

Look [Dm]around, the grass is [C]high
The fields are [Bb]ripe, it's the [A7]springtime of my [Dm]life

[Bb]Ahhh, seasons change with the [F]scenery
Weaving time in a [Cadd9]tapestry
Won't you stop and re[Dm]mem[D7sus2]ber    [Dm]me
[C]At any convenient time
[Bb]Funny how my memory slips while looking over manuscripts
[Am]Of unpublished rhyme
Drinking my [C]vodka and lime

I look [Dm]around, leaves are [C]brown now
And the [Bb]sky is a h[A7]azy shade of w[Dm]inter

Look a[C]round, leaves are [Bb]brown
There's a [A7]patch of snow on the [Dm]ground

Look a[C]round, leaves are [Bb]brown
There's a [A7]patch of snow on the [Dm]ground

Look a[C]round, leaves are [Bb]brown
There's a [A7]patch of snow on the [Dm]ground
