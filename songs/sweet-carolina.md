I we[C]nt down to Houston and I s[F]topped in San A[C]ntone
I pa[C]ssed up the station for the b[G]us
Was [F]trying to find me s[C]omething but I w[Am]asn't sure just w[F]hat
Man I ende[C]d up with p[G]ockets full of d[C]ust

So [C]I went on to Cleveland and I[F] ended up in[C]sane
Bou[C]ght a borrowed suit and learned to [G]dance
I w[F]as spendin' m[C]oney like the [Am]way it likes to r[F]ain
Man I e[C]nded up with [G]pockets full of [C]cane

Oh my [Am]swe-[F]eet Car[C]olina, [Am]what comp[F]els me to [G]go
Oh my [Am]swe-[F]eet dispos[C]ition, may you one day c[G]arry me h[F]ome

I a[C]in't never been to Vegas but I [F]gambled up my l[C]ife
Buil[C]ding newsprint boats I raced to sewer m[G]ains
Trying[F] to find me so[C]mething but I w[Am]asn't sure just w[F]hat
Funny h[C]ow they say that [G]some things never c[C]hange

Oh my [Am]swe-[F]eet Car[C]olina, [Am]what comp[F]els me to g[G]o
Oh my [Am]swe-[F]eet dispos[C]ition, may you one day [G]carry me h[F]ome

[Am]  [F]  [C]
[Am]  [F]  [G]
[Am] [F] [C]
[C] [C] [F]

Up [C]here in the city, it feels like t[F]hings are closin'[C]in
The [C]sunset's just my light bulb burning [G]out
I[F] miss Kent[C]ucky and I [Am]miss my famil[F]y
All the sw[C]eetest winds they [G]blow across the [C]south

Oh my [Am]swe-[F]eet Car[C]olina, [Am]what comp[F]els me to g[G]o
Oh my [Am]swe-[F]eet dispos[C]ition, may you o[C]ne day [G]carry me h[F]ome


May you o[Am]ne day [G]carry me [C]ho___[F]_me.
         [Am]    [G]       [C] [F]
                  [Am]    [G]       [C]
