[E][C#m]

[A]Years, [E]days, [B]makes no difference [A]to me babe
[E]You look exactly th[B]e same to [A]me
[A]Ain’t no t[E]ime, [B]crossing your legs insi[A]de the diner
[E]Raising your coffee to y[B]our lips, the st[A]eam

[A]You saw the master[E]piece, she looks a lot like y[A]ou
Wrapping her left a[E]rm around your right
[B]Ready to walk you [C#m]through[E] the night[C#m][E]

[A] You whisper to a r[E]estless ear,[B] “can you get me o[A]ut of here?
[E]This place smells like [B]piss and beer,[A]can you get me out?”
[A]You were asking m[E]e,     [B] how to get you [A]free
[E]I only know the re[B]cipe to r[A]oam

[A]You saw the master[E]piece, she looks a lot like y[A]ou
Wrapping her left a[E]rm around your right
[B]Ready to walk you [C#m]through[E] the night[C#m][E]

[A] Old s[E]tars
[B] Filling up my th[A]roat
[E] You gave em to me when I[B]was born
N[A]ow they’re coming out
[A] Laying there on the ho[E]spital bed[B] your eyes were narrow, b[A]lue and red
Y[E]ou took a draw of br[B]eath and said to m[A]e

[A]You saw the master[E]piece, she looks a lot like [A]me
Wrapping my left a[E]rm around your right
[B]Ready to walk you [C#m]through[E] the night[C#m][E]

(solo on verse)

[A] Old fri[E]ends,
[B] Old mothers, [A]dogs and brothers
[E] There’s only so much le[B]tting go you can a[A]sk someone to do
[A] So I keep you by [E]my side,[B] i will not give you [A]to the tide
[E] I'll even walk you in m[B]y stride, Ma[A]rie

'cause [A]I saw the masterp[E]iece, and she looks a lot like y[A]ou
Wrapping your left a[E]rm around my right
[B]Ready to walk me [C#m]through[E] the night[C#m][E][C#m][E]
