[D] [C] [G] [A] [D] 

[D]Oh Lord, I have made you a [C]place in my [G]heart
Among the [A]rags and the bones and the [Bm]dirt.
There's [D]piles of lies, the [C]love gone from her [G]eyes,
And [A]old moving boxes full of h[D]urt.

[C]Pull up a [G]chair by the [D]trouble and care.
I got [C]whiskey, you're [G]welcome to [A]some.
Oh [D]Lord, I have made you a [C]place in my h[G]eart,
But I [A]don't reckon you're gonna c[D]ome.

[D] [C] [G] [A] [D] 
[D]I've tried to fix up the place, I [C]know it's a dis[G]grace,
You get [A]used to it after a w[Bm]hile.
With the [D]flood and the drought and old [C]pals hanging [G]out
With their [A]IOU's nad their [D]smiles.

[C]Bare naked [G]women [D]keep coming in
And they [C]dance like you [G]wouldn't be[A]lieve.
Oh [D]Lord, I have made you a [C]place in my [G]heart,
So [A]take a good look - and then le[D]ave.

[D] [C] [G] [A] [D] 

[D]Oh Lord, why does the Fall get [C]colder each [G]year?
[A]Lord, why can't I learn to [Bm]love?
[D]Lord, if you made me, it's [C]easy to s[G]ee
That you [A]all make mistakes up abov[D]e.

But if I [C]open the [G]door, you will [D]know I'm poor
And my s[C]ecrets are [G]all that I [A]own.
Oh [D]Lord, I have made you a [C]place in my [G]heart
And I [A]hope that you leave it [D]alone.
