 [Em]Where do bad folks[D] go when they [G]die
They d[Em]on't go to heaven where the [A]angels fly[G]
[Em]Go to a lake of f[D]ire and f[G]ry
S[A]ee them again 'till the f[D]ourth of J[Em]uly

[Bm]I knew a lady who c[G]ame from Duluth
[Bm]Bitten by a dog with a r[F#]abid tooth
She [Bm]went to her grave just a l[G]ittle too soon
Fl[A]ew and lay down on the yellow m[Bm]oon

 [Em]Where do bad folks[D] go when they [G]die
They d[Em]on't go to heaven where the [A]angels fly[G]
[Em]Go to a lake of f[D]ire and f[G]ry
S[A]ee them again 'till the f[D]ourth of J[Em]uly

[Bm]People cry and p[G]eople moan
L[Bm]ook for a dry place to c[F#]all their home
[Bm]Try to find some place to r[G]est their bones
While the [A]angels and the devils try to [Bm]make 'em their own

 [Em]Where do bad folks[D] go when they [G]die
They d[Em]on't go to heaven where the [A]angels fly[G]
[Em]Go to a lake of f[D]ire and f[G]ry
S[A]ee them again 'till the f[D]ourth of J[Em]uly
