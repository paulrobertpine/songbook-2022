[G]To lead a [Bm]better life, [Bb]I need my love to be [Am]here[D7]

[G]Here[Am],   [Bm]making each [C]day of the [G]year[Am]
[Bm]Changing my [C]life with a [F#m]wave of her [B7]hand,
[F#m]Nobody [B7]can, [Em]deny that there's [Am]something [D7]there.

[G]Ther[Am]e,  [Bm]running my [C]hands through her [G]hair[Am]
[Bm]Both of us [C]thinking how [F#m]good it can [B7]be
[F#m]Someone is [B7]speaking, but [Em]she doesn't [Am]know he's [D7]there

I want her [Bb]everywhere[Gm]
And if [Cm]she's beside me [D7]I know I need [Gm]never care.
[Cm]But to love her [D7]is to need her

[G]Every[Am]where, [Bm]knowing that [C]love is to [G]share,[Am]
[Bm]Each one be[C]lieving that [F#m]love never [B7]dies
[F#m]Watching her [B7]eyes, and [Em]hoping I'm [Am]always [D7]there

I want her [Bb]everywhere[Gm]
And if [Cm]she's beside me [D7]I know I need [Gm]never care
[Cm]But to love her [D7]is to need her

[G]Every[Am]where, [Bm]knowing that [C]love is to [G]share,[Am]
[Bm]Each one be[C]lieving that [F#m]love never [B7]dies
[F#m]Watching her [B7]eyes, and [Em]hoping I'm [Am]always [D7]there

I will be [G]there[Am],  and [Bm]every[C]where.
[G]Here, [Am]there, and [Bm]every[C]where[G]
