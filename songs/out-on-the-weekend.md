[Bm][E][Bm][E] [Bm][E][Bm][E]
[C#m] [F#] [Bm] [E]

[A]Think I'll pack it in and [Bm]buy a pick-up
[E]Take it down to L.[A]A.
Find a place to call my [Bm]own and try to fix up.
[E]Start a brand new [A]day.

The [A]woman I'm thinking of, she [Bm]loved me all up
[E]But I'm so down to[A]day

She's so fine, she's in my mind.
[Bm]I hear her callin[E]g.[Esus4]

[A]See the lonely boy, [Bm]out on the weekend
[E]Trying to make it [A]pay.
Can't relate to joy, he [Bm]tries to speak and
[E]Can't begin to [A]say.

[A]She got pictures on the wall, [Bm]they make me look up
[E]From her big brass [A]bed.
Now I'm running down the road [Bm]trying to stay up
[E]Somewhere in her [A]head.

[A]The woman I'm thinking of, she [Bm]loved me all up
[E]But I'm so down tod[A]ay

She's so fine, she s in my mind.
[Bm]I hear her callin[E]g.[Esus4]

[A]See the lonely boy, [Bm]out on the weekend
[E]Trying to make it [A]pay.
Can't relate to joy, he [Bm]tries to speak and
[E]Can't begin to [A]say.
