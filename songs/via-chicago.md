[C]I dreamed about killing you a[G]gain last night
And it f[F]elt alright to me
[C]Dying on the banks of Em[G]barcadero skies
I s[F]at and watched you bleed
[C]Buried you alive in a f[G]ireworks display
[F]Raining down on me
[C]You cold, hot blood ran a[G]way from me
To the s[F]ea

- Harmonica break - same chord sequence-

[C]I painted my name on the b[G]ack of a leaf
And I [F]watched it float away
[C]The hope I had in a notebook [G]full of white, dry pages
Was a[F]ll I tried to save
But the wi[C]nd blew me back v[G]ia Chicago
In the m[F]iddle of the night
And a[C]ll without fight
At the c[G]rush of veils and starl[F]ight

- Harmonica break - same chord sequence-

I k[C]now I'll make it back
[G]One of these days and t[F]urn on your TV
To [C]watch a man with a f[G]ace like mine
Being ch[F]ased down a busy street
[C]When he gets caught, I wo[G]nt get up
And [F]I wont go to sleep
[C]I'm coming home,[G]I'm coming home
[F]Via Chicago

- Harmonica break - same chord sequence-

[C]Where the cups are cracked and hooked
[G]Above the sink
They m[F]ake me think
[C]Crumbling ladder tears d[G]on't fall
They shine down your s[F]houlders
[C]And crawling is screw faster l[G]ash
I blow it with [F]kisses
I [C]rest my head on a p[G]illowy star
And a c[F]racked door moon

That says I havent gone too far

[C] [G][F]

[C]I'm coming home,[G]I'm coming home
[F]Via Chicago
[C]I'm coming home,[G]I'm coming home
[F]

[C]Searching for a home
[G]Searching for a home
[F]Searching for a home

Via Chicago

[C]I'm coming home,[G]
[F]
