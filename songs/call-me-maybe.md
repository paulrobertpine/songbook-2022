[Intro]
G
 
[Verse 1]
G
I threw a wish in the well,
Em
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
C
I looked to you as it fell,
D
and now you're in my way
G
I trade my soul for a wish,
Em
pennies and dimes for a kiss
C
I wasn't looking for this,
D
but now you're in my way
G                                 Em
Your stare was holdin', ripped jeans, skin was showin'
C
Hot night, wind was blowin'
D
Where you think you're going, baby?
 
 
[Chorus]
G
Hey, I just met you,
D
and this is crazy,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
G
It's hard to look right,
D
at you baaaabeh,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
 
G
Hey, I just met you,
D
and this is crazy,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
G
And all the other boys,
D
try to chase me,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
 
 
[Verse 2]
G
You took your time with the call,
Em
I took no time with the fall
C
You gave me nothing at all,
D
but still, you're in my way
G
I beg and borrow and steal
Em
At first sight and it's real
C
I didn't know I would feel it,
D
but it's in my way
G                                 Em
Your stare was holdin', ripped jeans, skin was showin'
C
Hot night, wind was blowin'
D
Where you think you're going, baby?
 
 
[Chorus]
G
Hey, I just met you,
D
and this is crazy,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
G
It's hard to look right,
D
at you baaaabeh,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
 
G
Hey, I just met you,
D
and this is crazy,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
G
And all the other boys,
D
try to chase me,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
 
 
[Bridge]
G
Before you came into my life
D
I missed you so bad
C
I missed you so bad
D
I missed you so, so bad
 
G
Before you came into my life
D
I missed you so bad
C
And you should know that
D
I missed you so, so bad
 
 
[Chorus]
G
It's hard to look right,
Em
at you baaaabeh,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
 
G
Hey, I just met you,
D
and this is crazy,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
 
G
And all the other boys,
D
try to chaaase me,
C
but here's my number,
D
so call me, maybe?
 
 
[Outro]
G
Before you came into my life
D
I missed you so bad
C
I missed you so bad
D
I missed you so so bad
 
G
Before you came into my life
D
I missed you so bad
C
And you should know that
D
So call me, maybe?
