|[Gm]/ / / / |[F]/ / / / |[C]/ / / / |[Eb]/ / / / | x2

I was [Gm]lost in the [F]lakes
And the [C]shapes that your [Eb]body makes
That your [Gm]body makes, that your [F]body makes
That your [C]body makes  [Eb]

|[F]/ / / / |[Eb]/ / / / | (x2)

And the [Gm]mountains said I could [F]find you here
They [C]whispered the snow and the [Eb]leaves in my ear
I [Gm]traced my finger a-[F]long your trails
Your [C]body was the map, I was [Eb]lost in it

[Bb]Floating over your [F]rocky spine
The [C]glaciers made you, and [Eb]now you're mine
[Bb]Floating over your [F]rocky spine
The [C]glaciers made you, and [Eb]now you're mine

|[Gm]/ / / / |[F]/ / / / |[C]/ / / / |[Eb]/ / / / | (x2)

I was [Gm]moving across your [F]frozen veneer
The [C]sky was dark but [Eb]you were clear
[Gm]Could you feel my [F]footsteps
And would you [C]shatter, would you shatter, would you[Eb]

|[F]/ / / / |[Eb]/ / / / | (x2)

And with your [Gm]soft fingers be-[F]tween my claws
Like [C]purity a-[Eb]gainst resolve
I could [Gm]tell, then and there, we were [F]formed from the clay
And [C]came from the rocks for the [Eb]earth to display

They [Bb]told me to be [F]careful up there
Where the [C]wind blows a venomous [Eb]rage through your hair
They [Bb]told me to be [F]careful up there
Where the [C]wind rages through your [Eb]hair

|[Gm]/ / / / |[F]/ / / / |[C]/ / / / |[Eb]/ / / / | (x2)
