[Intro]
                                     Em
So where are you? It's been a little while
 
 
[Chorus]
                        C                              G
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me
                       Am
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
                           F                                   C
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
                     G                   Am
The moment is medical, moment is medical
                        C
Sippin' on straight chlorine
 
 
[Verse 1]
C                  G
   Lovin' what I'm tastin'
Am
   Venom on my tongue
 
   Dependant at times
C               G
   Poisonous vibration
Am
   Help my body run
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                   F              Am
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
               G
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
 
 
[Chorus]
                        C                              G
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me
                       Am
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
                           F                                   C
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
                     G                   Am
The moment is medical, moment is medical
                        C
Sippin' on straight chlorine
 
 
[Verse 2]
C                 G
   Fall out of formation
Am
   I plan my escape from walls they confined
C               G
   Rebel red carnation
Am
   Grows while I decay
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                   F              Am
I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
               G
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
                         F              Am
Yeah, I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
               G
Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-i-ife
 
 
[Verse 3]
N.C.          C
Had you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red
  G
I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
              Am
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead
 
The last two lines may read incorrect until said
            F
The lead is terrible in flavor
            C
But now you double as a papermaker
  G
I despise you sometimes
 
I love to hate the fight and you in my life is like
 
 
[Chorus]
                        C                              G
Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me
                       Am
This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical
                           F                                   C
When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete
                     G                   Am
The moment is medical, moment is medical
                        C
Sippin' on straight chlorine
 
 
[Interlude]
C
   Let the vibe, let the vibe
G
   Let the vibe, let the vibe
Am
   Beat is a chemical, yeah
C
   Let the vibe, let the vibe
G
   Let the vibe, let the vibe
Am
   Moment is medical, yeah
 
   Sippin' on straight chlorine
C
   Let the vibe, let the vibe
G
   Let the vibe, let the vibe
Am
   Beat is a chemical, yeah
C
   Let the vibe, let the vibe
G
   Let the vibe, let the vibe
Am
   Moment is medical, yeah
 
 
[Bridge]
F      C           Am
I'm so sorry, I forgot you
F      Am              G     Am
Let me catch you up to speed
C         G               Am
I've been tested like the end of
  F         Am                 G   Am
A weathered flag that's by the sea
 
 
[Outro]
        F        Am             G
Can you build my house with pieces?
                Am
I'm just a chemical
        F        Am             G
Can you build my house with pieces?
                Am
I'm just a chemical
        F        Am             G
Can you build my house with pieces?
                Am
I'm just a chemical
        F        Am             G
Can you build my house with pieces?
                Am
I'm just a chemical
