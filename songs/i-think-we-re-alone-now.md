[D]Children be-[F#m]have
[Bm]That's what they say [A]when we're together
[D]And watch how you [F#m]play
[Bm]They don't under-[A]stand and so we're

[F#m]Running just as fast as we [D]can
[F#m]Holding on to one another's [D]hand
[C]Tryin' to get away into the night and then you
[A]put your arms around me and we tumble to the ground and then you say

[D]I think we're alone [A]now
[G]doesn't seem to be [D]anyone around
[D]I think we're alone [A]now
The [G]beating of our hearts is the [D]only sound

(verse 2)
[D]Look out the [F#m]way
[Bm]We gotta [A]hide what we're doing
[D]'Cause what would they [F#m]say?
[Bm]If they ever [A]knew and saw it?

[F#m]Running just as fast as we [D]can
[F#m]Holding on to one another's [D]hand
[C]Tryin' to get away into the night and then you
[A]put your arms around me and we tumble to the ground and then you say

[D]I think we're alone [A]now
[G]doesn't seem to be [D]anyone around
