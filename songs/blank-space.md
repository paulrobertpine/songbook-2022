[D]Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible [Bm]things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought
[G]Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
[A]Love's a game, want to play?
[D]New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a maga-[Bm]zine
Ain't it funny, rumors, lie
And I know you heard about [G]me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
[A]Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[D]So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
[Bm]You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
[Em]Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
[G]'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

[D]'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
[Bm]It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
[Em]Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
[G]But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

[D / / / /]

[D]Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible []things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your []Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
[A]Wait the worst is yet to come, oh no
[D]Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables [Bm]turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
[G]"Oh my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
[A]But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[D]So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
[Bm]You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
[Em]Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
[G]'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

[D]'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
[Bm]It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
[Em]Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
[G]But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

[D]Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya

[D]So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
[Bm]You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
[Em]Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
[G]'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

[D]'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
[Bm]It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
[Em]Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
[G]But I've got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name
