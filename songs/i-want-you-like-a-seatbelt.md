[A]I like crumbs and chrome he[E]adlights
Carnivals and ca[A]nines, boardwalk girls who p[D]lay nice
Cars and their en[A]gines, a bridge in its susp[E]ension
The sun shadowing the e[A]ast[D][A]

And [A]I like how your dress looks with that l[E]amp shade
How people always te[A]ll me, you’re the best friend they e[D]ver made
Take me to the co[A]mmune, we can live with Cat Ste[E]vens
He can play the t[A]ambo[D]urine[A]

Oh, I[E]’d like to live up in a h[A]ouse that lives up in a t[D]ree
Only you and m[A]e, maybe a kid, maybe th[E]ree
Maybe from the to[A]p, you can [D]see that

[A]I want you across my h[E]ips, fastened low and t[A]ight
In the middle of the wo[D]ods, in the middle of the ni[F#m]ght
We can let the world fal[E]l away, one kiss at a t[A]ime[D][A]

[A]I like my Mustangs uns[E]hod
the coy-wolves of Cape C[A]od
The tillerman and big ma[D]ud
gone but not fo[A]rgotten
The wind catching the ca[E]ution,
so let it all be f[A]ree[D][A]

[A]Let’s take another unplanned r[E]oad trip,
leave behind New E[A]ngland
Maybe we can fi[D]nd
our Lefty’s sister Ing[A]rid
Leave the frozen ri[E]vers
to some place we’ve never [A]see[D]n[A]

Oh, I[E]’d like to live up in a h[A]ouse that lives up in a t[D]ree
Only you and m[A]e, maybe a kid, maybe th[E]ree
Maybe from the to[A]p, you can [D]see that

[F#m]I want you across my hi[E]ps, fastened low and ti[A]ght
In the middle of the wo[D]ods, in the middle of the ni[F#m]ght
We can let the world fal[E]l away, one kiss at a t[A]ime[D][A]

Let the world f[E]all away, one kiss at a t[A]ime[D][A]
