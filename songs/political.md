A                    Asus2
I was tired of being put right down by my
D                           
self for not being what you thought you had found
A              Asus2
Pulled hard in two directions by a
D
desire to learn and my old affections
A                        Asus2
When I tried to share my world with you
D
you could not seem to tolerate the
A             Asus2
people I have grown to love
D
They shrank under your scrutiny, became the ones you'd hate, why did

A           Asus2
everything, every little thing, every little thing with you and
D
me have to be so political
A           Asus2
Everything, every little thing, every little thing with you and
D            D    A        ( Asus2  D   D   A   Asus2  D  A  E )*
me had to be so political

A                      Asus2
I was feeling a little underwhelmed about
D
hanging 'round with you and feeling over-cautious
A                                         Asus2
Every word, every little look, every little sign, every little
D
phrase put me deeper in your doghouse
A                       Asus2
You'd let me out to run across your world, I
D
ran into a wall, you told me I built it then you'd
A                   Asus2
Reel me in, ream me out, pick me up, push me
D
out again, and then repeat, why did
 
CHORUS

E                                  D
Too busy tripping on my tongue, to try and stand my ground
      E                                          D
I can still see myself crying in your lap asking you
 
"Are you happy with the man you have found?"
 
A       Asus2   D       D  
Solo (repeated 4 times)

A                         Asus2
I'm grateful for what you did for me
      D
I can see things now I never would have seen
      A                        Asus2
And today I thought about what could have been but could
D
Never be for you and me because
