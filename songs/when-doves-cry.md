[Am][G][Em][F][G]

[Am]Dig if you will the pi[G]cture
Of y[Em]ou and I engaged in a k[F]iss[G]
[Am]The sweat of your body co[G]vers me
[Em]Can you my darling
C[F]an you pic[G]ture this?

[Am]Dream if you can a cou[G]rtyard
An o[Em]cean of violets in bl[F]oom[G]
[Am]Animals strike cur[G]ious poses
[Em]They feel the heat
The h[F]eat between [G]me and you


[Am]How can you just leave me sta[G]nding?
[Em]Alone in a world that's so c[F]old?[G](So cold)
[Am]Maybe I'm just too dem[G]anding
[Em]Maybe I'm just like my fa[F]ther t[G]oo bold
[Am]Maybe you're just like my mo[G]ther
[Em]She's never sati[F]sfied[G](She's never satisfied)
[Am]Why do we scream at each o[G]ther
[Em]This is what it sounds like
W[F]hen do[G]ves cry

Am G Em F G 2x

[Am]Touch if you will my sto[G]mach
[Em]Feel how it trembles in[F]side[G]
[Am]You've got the butterf[G]lies all tied up
[Em]Don't make me chase you
[F]Even d[G]oves have pride

[Am]How can you just leave me sta[G]nding?
[Em]Alone in a world that's so c[F]old?[G](So cold)
[Am]Maybe I'm just too dem[G]anding
[Em]Maybe I'm just like my fa[F]ther t[G]oo bold
[Am]Maybe you're just like my mo[G]ther
[Em]She's never sati[F]sfied[G](She's never satisfied)
[Am]Why do we scream at each o[G]ther
[Em]This is what it sounds like
W[F]hen do[G]ves cry

[F]When d[G]oves cry
