[Intro]
[B] [E][E][B]

[Verse 1]
[B]I lived in a place called Okfu [E]skee
[E]And I had a little girl in a holler [B]tree
[B]I said, little girl, it's plain to [E]see
[E]Ain't nobody that can sing like [B]me
[F#]Ain't nobody that can sing like[G#m]me

[Verse 2]
[B]She said it's hard for me to [E]see
[E]How one little boy got so ug[B]ly
[B]Yes my little girly that might [E]be
[E]But there ain't nobody that can sing like [B]me
[F#]Ain't nobody that can sing like [G#m]me

[Chorus]
[E]Way over yonder in the minor [B]key
[F#]Way over yonder in the minor[B]key
[F#]There ain't nobody that can sing like [G#m]me

[Verse 3]
[B]We walked down by the Buckeye [E]Creek
[E]To see the frog eat the goggle-eye [B]bee
[B]To hear the west wind whistle to the [E]east
[E]There ain't nobody that can sing like [B]me
[F#]Ain't nobody that can sing like [G#m]me

[B]Oh my little girly will you le[E]t me see
[E]Way over yonder where the wind blows [B]free
[B]Nobody can see in our holler t[E]ree
[E]And there ain't nobody that can sin[B]g like me
[F#]Ain't nobody that can sing like [G#m]me

[Chorus]
[E]Way over yonder in the minor [B]key
[F#]Way over yonder in the mino[B]r key
[F#]Ain't nobody that can sing like [G#m]me

[Interlude]
[E](Playe[B]d lik[F#]e the[B] choru[F#]s) [G#m]

[Verse 4]
[B]Her mama cut a switch from a cherry [E]tree
[E]And laid it on the she and [B]me
[B]It stung lots worse than a hive of [E]bees
[E]But there ain't nobody that can sing like [B]me
[F#]Ain't nobody that can sing like [G#m]me

[B]Now I have walked a long long [E]ways
[E]And I still look back to my Tanglewood [B]days
[B]I've led lots of girls since then to [E]stray
[E]Saying ain't nobody that can sing like [B]me
[F#]Ain't nobody that can sing like [G#m]me

[Chorus]
[E]Way over yonder in the minor [B]key
[F#]Way over yonder in the minor[B]key
[F#]Ain't nobody that can sing like[B]me
[F#]Ain't nobody that can sing like [G#m]me
