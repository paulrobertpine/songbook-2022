|[C]/ / [Csus2]/ / |[C] / / [Csus4]/ / |

There was a [Am]camp town [G]man, used to p[F]low and s[C]ing
[Am]And he loved that [G]mule and the [F]mule loved [C]him
When the [Am]day got [G]long as it [F]does about [C]now
[Am]I'd hear him [G]singing to his [F]muley [C]cow

[C]Calling, "Come on my sweet old girl,
I'd bet the whole damn world, that
we're gonna [Dm]make it [C/E]yet to the end of the [G]road"[Gsus][G]


Singing [Am]hard times[G] ain't gonna [F]rule my [C]mind
[Am]Hard times[G] ain't gonna [F]rule my [C]mind, Bessie
[Am]Hard times [G]ain't gonna [F]rule [G]my mind no [C]more[Cmaj7]

Said it's a [Am]mean old [G]world, [F]heavy in [C]need
[Am]That big mac[G]hine is just a [F]picking up [C]speed
They were [Am]supping on [G]tears, they were [F]supping on [C]wine
[Am]We all get to [G]heaven in our [F]own sweet [C]time

[C]So come all you Asheville boys
'n turn up your old-time noise
'n kick 'til the dust [Dm]comes [C/E]up from the cracks in the [G]flo[Gsus]or[G]

Singing [Am]hard times[G] ain't gonna [F]rule my [C]mind, brother
[Am]Hard times[G] ain't gonna [F]rule my [C]mind
[Am]Hard times[G] ain't gonna [F]rule my [G]mind no[C]more

But the [Am]camptown [G]man, he doesn't [F]plow no [C]more
[Am]I seen him [G]walking down to the [F]superette [C]store
Guess he [Am]lost that [G]knack and he [F]forgot that [C]song
[Am]Woke up one [G]morning and the [F]mule was [C]gone


[C]So come all you ragtime kings,
'n come on you dogs and sing
'n pick up the [Dm]dusty old [C/E]horn and give it a [G]blo[Gsus]w[G]

Playing [Am]hard times[G] ain't gonna [F]rule my [C]mind, honey
[Am]Hard times[G] ain't gonna [F]rule my [C]mind, sugar
[Am]Hard times[G] ain't gonna [F]rule my [G]mind no [C]more[Cmaj7]
