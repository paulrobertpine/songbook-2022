[Am] I [C]hurt mys[D]elf to[Am]day   to [C]see if [D]I still [Am]feel
I [C]focus[D] on the p[Am]ain   the [C]only th[D]ing that's [Am]real
The [C]needle [D]tears a [Am]hole   the [C]old fam[D]iliar st[Am]ing
Try to [C]kill it[D] all aw[Am]ay   but I re[C]member [D]everyth[G]ing

[Am]What have I beco[F]me?   [C]  My sweetest fr[G]iend
[Am]Everyone I k[F]now  goes away[C] in the e[G]nd
And [Am]you could have it a[F]ll   [G]My empire of dir[G]t
[Am]I will let you d[F]own    [G]I will make you h[Am]urt

[Am]   I [C]wear this [D]crown of [Am]thorns   u[C]pon my [D]liar's c[Am]hair
[C]Full of [D]broken th[Am]oughts   [C]I cann[D]ot re[Am]pair
Be[C]neath the s[D]tains of [Am]time   the [C]feelings[D] disappe[Am]ar
[C]You are so[D]meone e[Am]lse   [C]I am s[D]till right h[G]ere

[Am]What have I beco[F]me?   [C]  My sweetest fr[G]iend
[Am]Everyone I k[F]now  goes away[C] in the e[G]nd
And [Am]you could have it a[F]ll   [G]My empire of [G]dirt
[Am]I will let you d[F]own   [G]I will make you [G]hurt
If [Am]I could start aga[F]in  a [G]million miles a[G]way
[Am]I would keep mys[F]elf  [G]I would find a way
