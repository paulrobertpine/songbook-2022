[Verse 1]
Her hair is Harlowe [F]go[Am]ld,[G] her lips a sweet [F]surprise[G][C]
Her hands are never [F]co[Am]ld,[G] she's got Bette Davis [C]eyes
She'll turn the [Am]music [F]on you[Am][G]
You won't have to think [F]twice[G][Am]
She's pure as New York [F]sn[Am]ow,[G] she's got Bette Davis [C]eyes[C7]

[Chorus 1]
And she'll [Am]tease you, she'll [C]unease you,
All the [F]better just to [C]please you,
She's [Am]precocious, and she [C]knows just what it [F]takes
to make a [C]pro blush
She's got [F]  Greta Garbo's [Am]standoff sighs
She's got [G]Bette Davis [F]eyes[Am][G][F][Am][G]

She'll let you take her [F]ho[Am]me,[G] you whet her appetite[F][G][C]
She'll lay you on her [F]th[Am]ron[G]e, she's got Bette Davis [C]eyes
She'll take a [Am]tumble [F]on you[Am][G]
Roll you like you were [F]dice,[G][Am]
Until you come up [F]bl[Am]ue,[G] she's got Bette Davis [C]eyes

[Chorus 2]
She'll [Am]expose you, when she [C]snows you
Off your [F]feet with the crumbs she thr[C]ows you
She's f[Am]erocious and she [C]knows just what it [F]takes to make a
[C]pro blush[F]
All the boys [Am]think she's a spy
She's got[G] Bette Davis [F]eyes[Am][G][F][Am][G]
And she'll [Am]tease you, she'll un[C]ease you
All the [F]better just to [C]please you
She's [Am]precocious and she [C]knows just what it [F]takes to
make a [C]pro blush[F]
All the boys [Am]think she's a spy
She's got[G] Bette Davis [F]eyes[Am][G][F][Am][G][F][Am][G][F][Am][G]
And she'll [F]tease yo[Am]u, [G]she'll [F]unease you,[Am][G]
Just to [F]please you[Am], s[G]he's got Bette Davis [F]eyes[G][C]

And she [F]knows [Am]you, [G]she's got Bette Davis [F]eyes[G][C]
