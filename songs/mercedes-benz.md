[D]Oh Lord, won't you buy me a [G]Mercedes [D]Benz?
[D]My friends all drive Porsches, and I must make [A7]amends.
Worked [D]hard all my lifetime, no [G]help from my [D]friends,
So oh! [D]Lord, won't you buy me a [A7]Mercedes [D]Benz?

[D]Oh Lord, won't you buy me a [G]color T[D]V?
"[D]Dialing for dollars" is trying to find [A7]me,
I [D]wait for delivery each [G]day until th[D]ree,
So oh [D]Lord, won't you buy me a [A7]color T[D]V?

Oh [D]Lord, won't you buy me a [G]night on the [D]town?
I'm [D]counting on you, lord, please don't let me [A7]down.
[D]Prove that you love me and [G]buy the next ro[D]und,
Oh [D]Lord, won't you buy me a [A7]night on the [D]town?

[D]Oh Lord, won't you buy me a [G]Mercedes [D]Benz?
My [D]friends all drive Porsches, and I must make a[A7]mends.
Worked [D]hard all my lifetime, no [G]help from my fr[D]iends,
So oh! [D]Lord, won't you buy me a [A7]Mercedes [D]Benz?
