Capo 3

[Intro]
| G | Em |  [x4]
 
G        Em           G            Em
Woo-hooh whoo-hoo-ooh whoo-ooh ooh hoo ooh
 
[repeat]
 
[Verse]
     G      Em             G        B7
It's always summer in this Southern state
            C        G    C           Em
Where I'm behind the moon floating in space
    G          Em           G                B7
But I'm not in hiding, just trying not to be found
          C       G      C           Em
So when I hear my name I never turn around
 
G        Em           G            Em
Woo-hooh whoo-hoo-ooh whoo-ooh ooh hoo ooh
 
[Verse]
G           Em          G             B7
Here in the valley they live in their cars
        C        G             C         Em
As they dream of fields, under oceans of stars
    G        Em      G         B7
And I'm disappearing into that grid
           C               G     C         Em
Where I'll live out in the open, perfectly hid
 
G        Em           G            Em
Woo-hooh whoo-hoo-ooh whoo-ooh ooh hoo ooh
 
[Verse]
     G      Em             G        B7
It's always summer in this Southern state
           C           G          C         Em
And it's a comfortable life, in a beautiful place
    G           Em        G           B7
But something's rattling, somewhere inside
       C                G                C             Em
And it sounds like it's broken, but in a place I can't find
       B7                    C/G
And it only gets louder with time
 
G        Em           G            Em
Woo-hooh whoo-hoo-ooh whoo-ooh ooh hoo ooh
 
[repeat x3]
 
[Outro]
G
