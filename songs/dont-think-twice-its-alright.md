Well it [C]ain't no use to [G]sit and wonder [Am]why, babe
[F]Ifin' you don't know by [C]now[G]
An' it [C]ain't no use to [G]sit and wonder [Am]why, babe
[D7]It'll never do some-[G]how
When your [C]rooster crows at the [C7]break a dawn
[F]Look out your window and [D7]I'll be gone
[C]You're the [G]reason I'm [Am]trav'lin' [F]on
But [C]Don't think [G]twice, it's al-[C]right

And it [C]ain't no use in a-[G]turnin' on your [Am]light, babe
[F]The light I never [C]knowed[G]
An' it [C]ain't no use in [G]turnin' on your [Am]light, babe
[D7]I'm on the dark side of the [G]road
But I [C]wish there was somethin' you would [C7]do or say
To [F]try and make me change my [D7]mind and stay
[C]We never [G]did too much [Am]talkin' any-[F]way
But [C]Don't think [G]twice, it's al-[C]right

No it [C]ain't no use in [G]callin' out my [Am]name, gal
[F]Like you never done be-[C]fore[G]
And it [C]ain't no use in [G]callin' out my [Am]name, gal
[D7]I can't hear ya any-[G]more
I'm a-[C]thinkin' and a-wond'rin' [C7]wallkin' way down the road
[F]I once loved a woman, a [D7]child I am told
I [C]give her my [G]heart but she [Am]wanted my [F]soul
But [C]Don't think [G]twice, it's al-[C]right

| [C]/ / [G]/ / | [Am]/ / [F]/ / | [C]/ / [G]/ / | [C]/ / / / |[C]/ / / / |

So [C]looo-[G]ooong honey [Am]babe
Where I'm [F]bound, I can't [C]tell[G]
[C]Goodbye is [G]too good a [Am]word, babe
[D7]So I just say fare thee [G]well
[C]I ain't sayin' you treated [C7]me unkind
You [F]could have done better but [D7]I don't mind
[C]You just kinda [G]wasted my [Am]precious [F]time
But [C]Don't think [G]twice, it's al-[C]right
