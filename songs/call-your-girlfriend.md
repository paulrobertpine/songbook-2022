Call your [C]girlfriend[G]
It's time you [C]had the [G]talk
Give your [C]reasons[G]
Say it's [C]not [G]her [Em]fault
But [D]you [Em]just [C]met some[G]body [D]new

Tell her not to get [Em]upset, second-guessing [D]everything you said and [G]done
And then when she gets [C]upset tell her how you [Em]never meant to hurt no [D]one

Then you tell her that the [G]only way her [D]heart will mend is
[Em]when she learns to [C]love again
And it [G]won't make sense right [D]now but you're still her
[Em]friend and then you let her down [D]easy[C]

But [D]you [Em]just [C]met some[G]body [D]new

Don't you tell her how I [Em]give you something that you [D]never even knew you [G]missed
Don't you even try and [C]explain how it's so [Em]different when we [D]kiss

You just tell her that the [G]only way her [D]heart will mend is
[Em]when she learns to [C]love again
And it [G]won't make sense right [D]now but you're still her
[Em]friend and then you let her down [D]easy[C]
