 Well he [E]caressed her breast she[G#7] hie di died his [C#m]thigh[E7]
 And the [A]pill lit on the pillow amongst the [B]wine bottles and the [E]cheese
 Took a [E]Polaroid picture that was [G#7]naughty and it [C#m]slipped [E7]yes it did
 And [A]just when they thought it couldn't [B]get no better then it [E]did

 [E]Just when you think it can't [G#7]get no better then it [C#m]does[E7]
 It's [A]always so much [B]better than it ever [E]was
 [E]Seems like all the g[G#7]ood things come at [C#m]once,     [E7]yes they do
 And [A]just when you think it can't [B]get no better then it [E]does

 Well they [E]knew what they liked they ain't [G#7]neither one of them [C#m]naive[E7]
 She said I'll [A]probably get in trouble but this [B]time I don't [E]care
 Well I s[E]hould go to work but I'd [G#7]rather be with you [C#m]instead[E7]
 And [A]just when they thought it couldn't [B]get no better then it [E]did

 [E]Just when you think it can't [G#7]get no better then it [C#m]does[E7]
 It's [A]always so much [B]better than it ever [E]was
 [E]Seems like all the g[G#7]ood things come at [C#m]once,     [E7]yes they do
 And [A]just when you think it can't [B]get no better then it [E]does

 She [E]taught school and he [G#7]played the five string [C#m]banjo[E7]
 She lived [A]here in town and he [B]traveled the whole world [E]wide
 Well she [E]packed the lunch brought the wine he drove the [G#7]car and scored a [C#m]lid[E7]
 And [A]just when they thought it couldn't [B]get no better then it [E]did

 [E]Just when you think it can't [G#7]get no better then [C#m]it does[E7]

 It was a [E]perfect day for a [G#7]dalliance and a [C#m]picnic[E7]
 And a [A]riverbank was an [B]excellent place to [E]love
 Well the [E]sun was a shining and the [G#7]birds were a singing [C#m]overhead  ([E7]whistles)
 And [A]just when they thought it couldn't [B]get no better then it [E]did

 [E]Just when you think it can't [G#7]get no better then [C#m]it does[E7]
 It's [A]always so much [B]better than it ever [E]was
 [E]Seems like all the g[G#7]ood things come at [C#m]once,     [E7]yes they do
 And [A]just when you think it can't [B]get no better then it [E]does

 And [A]just when you think it can't [B]get no better then it [E]dooooooOOOO
