[D] I feel it all, I fe[G]el it all[G][Bm]
[D] I feel it all, I fe[G]el it all[G][Bm]
[D]   The wings are wide, the w[G]ings are wide[G][Bm]
[D]   Wild card inside,    w[G]ild card inside[G][Bm]

[F#]Oh I’ll be the o[G]ne who'll break my h[Em]eart  I'll be the on[A]e to hold the gun

[D]   I know more than I k[G]new before[G][Bm]
[D]   I know more than I kn[G]ew before[G][Bm]
[D]   I didn't rest, I did[G]n't stop[G][Bm]
[D]   Did we fight or d[G]id we talk[G][Bm]

[F#]Oh I’ll be the o[G]ne who'll break my h[Em]eart  I'll be the on[A]e to hold the gun

[D]I love you more[G][G][Bm]
[D]I love you more[G][G][Bm]
[D]I don't know what I kn[G]ew before[G][Bm]
[D]But now I know I want to w[G]in the war[G][Bm]

[G]No one likes to take a test, [Em]Sometimes you know more is less
[G]Put your weight against the door, Kic[A]k drum on the basement floor
[G]Stranded in a fog of words, Lo[A]ved him like a winter bird
[G]On my head the water pours, Gu[Em]lf stream through the open door

[F#m]Fly away Fl[G]y away to what you wa[A]nt to make  [(stop]Oh-oh-[playing)]oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh OH!
[D]I feel it all    I f[G]eel it all[G][Bm]
[D]I feel it all    I f[G]eel it all[G][Bm]
[D]The wings are wide   The wi[G]ngs are wide[G][Bm]
[D]Wild card in sight, wild c[G]ard in sight[G][Bm]

[F#m]Oh I’ll be the on[G]e who'll break my heart
[Em]I'll be the on[A]e who'll break my [F#m]heart
I'll be the [G]one who'll break my [A]heart
[A]I'll end it, though you s[F#m]tarted it

[D]  The truth li[G]es[G][Bm]
[D]   The truth li[G]ed[G][Bm]
[D]  And Lies Div[G]ide[G][Bm]
[D]     Lies Divid[G]e[G][Bm]

End on D
