[Em7]Peace like a riv[Am]er ran through the cit[G]y
Lo[C]ng past the midnight c[G]urfew We sat [C]starry-ey[Am]ed
Ah,ah, We were satisfi[Em7]ed
[Em]Ah, And I remember Misinformation f[Am]ollowed us like a pl[G]ague
N[C]obody knew from t[G]ime to time If the pl[C]ans were changed[Am]
A[Am/G]h, ah,  A[D7/F#]h, If the p[G]lans were changed.[Am7][G/B]

[Am]You can beat us with wires[G]
You can beat us with chains[D7/F#]

You can run out your rules
But you know you can't ou[Em]trun the history train[Am7][G/B]
[Am7]I've seen a glorious day, a[Gmaj7]iee         [D]   ee[Em]

[Em]Four in the morning
[Am]I woke up from out of m[G]y dreams
[C]Nowhere to go but b[G]ack to sleep
But I[C]'m reconciled[Am]
Oh, oh[Am/G], oh, [D7/F#]I'm going to be up[Em7]for awhile
O[C]h, oh[Am/G], oh, [D7/F#]I'm going to be up[Em7]for awhile
O[C]h, oh[Am/G], oh, [D7/F#]I'm going to be up[Em7]for awhile
