[G]A man walks d[D]own the street,
he says[C] why am I s[D]oft in the middle now,
[G]why am I s[D]oft in the middle,
[C]the rest of my l[D]ife is so hard,
[G]I need a ph[D]oto-opportunity,
[C]I want a shot at red[D]emption,
[G]dont want to end up a c[D]artoon,
in a[C] cartoon gr[D]aveyard,
b[G]onedigger, b[D]onedigger,
[C]dogs in the mo[D]onlight,
[G]far aw[D]ay my w[C]ell-lit d[D]oor,
Mr. B[G]eerbelly, B[D]eerbelly,
g[C]et these mutts aw[D]ay from me,
you kn[G]ow I don't f[D]ind this stuff am[C]using anym[D]ore.

[G]If youll be my b[D]odyguard
[C]I can be your l[D]ong l[G]ost p[D]al,[C][D]
[G]I can call you B[D]etty,
and B[C]etty when you c[D]all me
you can c[G]all me Al.[D][C][D]

[G]A man walks d[D]own the street,
he says[C] why am I s[D]hort of attention,
[G]got a short l[D]ittle span of attention,
and wo [C]my nights a[D]re so long,
[G]wheres my wif[D]e and family,
what if[C] I die here[D],
[G]wholl be my r[D]ole-model,
now tha[C]t my role-m[D]odel is
[G]gone, gone,[D]
he duck[C]ed back dow[D]n the alley
[G]with some rol[D]y-poly little[C] bat-faced [D]girl,
[G]all along, al[D]ong
there were inci[C]dents and ac[D]cidents,
there were hints and allegations.

[G]If youll be my b[D]odyguard
[C]I can be your l[D]ong l[G]ost p[D]al,[C][D]
[G]I can call you B[D]etty,
and B[C]etty when you c[D]all me
you can c[G]all m[D]e  A[C]l.[D]
call me [G]Al.[D][C][D]

[G]A man walks d[D]own the street,
its a s[C]treet in a [D]strange world,
[G]maybe its the[D]Third World,
maybe i[C]ts his firs[D]t time around,
[G]he doesnt spe[D]ak the language,
he hold[C]s no curren[D]cy,
[G]he is a forei[D]gn man,
he is s[C]urrounded b[D]y
[G]the sound, th[D]e sound,
cattle [C]in the mark[D]etplace,
[G]scatterlings [D]and orphanages,[C][D]
[G]he looks arou[D]nd, around,
he sees[C] angels in [D]the architecture,
[G]spinning in i[D]nfinity,
he says[C] Amen and H[D]allelujah!

[G]If youll be my b[D]odyguard
[C]I can be your l[D]ong l[G]ost p[D]al,[C][D]
[G]I can call you B[D]etty,
and B[C]etty when you c[D]all me
you can c[G]all me Al.[D][C][D]
