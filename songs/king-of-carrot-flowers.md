[Verse]

[F]When you were young
You were the [C]king of carrot [Bb]flowers[F]
And how you built a tower [C]tumbling through the [Bb]trees[C]
In holy rattlesnakes that [Bb]fell all around your [F]feet

[Bb] [F][C][Bb]

[Chorus]

[F]  And your mom would stick a fork right [C]into daddy's [Bb]shoulder[F]
And dad would throw the garbage [C]all across the [Bb]floor[C]
As we would lay and learn what [Bb]each other's bodies were [F]for

 [Bb]  [F]  [C]  [Bb]
[F] [Bb][F][C][Bb]

[Verse]

[F]And this is the room
One after[C]noon I knew I could [Bb]love you[F]
And from above you how I [C]sank into your [Bb]soul[C]
Into that secret place where [Bb]no one dares to [F]go

[Bb] [F][C][Bb]

[Chorus]

[F]  And your mom would drink until she wa[C]s no longer[Bb] speaking[F]
And dad would dream of all the [C]different ways to [Bb]die[C]
Each one a little more than [Bb]he could dare to [F]try

[Bb]  [F]  [C]  [Bb]
[F]  [Bb]  [F]  [C]  [Bb]
[F]  [Bb]  [F]  [C]  [Bb]
[F]  [Bb]  [F]  [C]  [Bb] [F]
