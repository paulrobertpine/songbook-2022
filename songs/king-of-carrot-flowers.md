  When you were young
             C              Bb       F
You were the king of carrot flowers
                          C                    Bb     C
And how you built a tower tumbling through the trees
                          Bb                   F
In holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet
 
Bb  F  C  Bb
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F                                       C            Bb        F
  And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder
                                C              Bb      C
And dad would throw the garbage all across the floor
                               Bb                       F
As we would lay and learn what each other's bodies were for
 
Bb  F  C  Bb
 
F  Bb  F  C Bb
 
 
[Verse]
 
F
  And this is the room 
         C                   Bb        F
One afternoon I knew I could love you
                         C              Bb    C
And from above you how I sank into your soul
                             Bb              F
Into that secret place where no one dares to go
 
Bb  F  C  Bb
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F                                      C          Bb        F
  And your mom would drink until she was no longer speaking
                               C                 Bb   C
And dad would dream of all the different ways to die
                            Bb               F
Each one a little more than he could dare to try
 
Bb  F  C  Bb
F  Bb  F  C Bb
F  Bb  F  C  Bb
F  Bb  F  C  Bb  F
