Well the [G]stairs sound so [D7]lonely [G]without you
[B]And I ain't made my bed in a [C]week
Coffee [C]stains on the [D7]paper I'm [G]writing[E7]
And I'm [A7]too choked up inside to [D7]speak

[G]And Yes, I [D7]know our [G]differences pulled us apart
[B]Never spoke a word heart to [C]heart
And I'm [C]glad [D7]that you're [G]gone[E7]
But I [A7]wish to the [D7]lord that you'd come [G]home[D7]

And I'm [G]glad [D7]that you're [G]gone
[B]Got the feeling so [C]strong
And I'm [C]glad [D]that you're [G]gone[E7]
But I [A7]wish to the [D7]lord that you'd come [G]home[D7]

Well my [G]guitar still [D7]plays your [G]favorite song
[B]though the strings have been outta tune for some [C]time
Every [C]time I strum a [D7]chord, I [G]pray out to the [E7]lord
That you'll [A7]quit your honkey-[D7]tonkin' sing my [G]song[D7]

And I'm [G]glad [D7]that you're [G]gone
[B]Got the feeling so [C]strong
And I'm [C]glad [D]that you're [G]gone[E7]
But I [A7]wish to the [D7]lord that you'd come [G]home[D7]

[G]So I'll throw another [D7]log onto the [G]fire
[B]And I'll admit I'm a lousy liar[C]
As the [C]coals die down and [D7]flicker
I [G]hear that guitar [E7]picker
Play the [A7]song we used to [D7]sing so long a-[G]go[D7]

I'm [G]glad [D7]that you're [G]gone
[B]Got the feeling so [C]strong
Yes I'm [C]glad [D7]that you're [G]gone[E7]
But I [A7]wish to the [D7]lord that you'd come [G]home[E7]
And I'm [G]glad, [D7]damn glad you're [G]gone
[B]Got the feeling so [C]strong
And I'm [C]glad [D7]that you're [G]gone[E7]
But I [A7]wish to the [D7]lord that you'd come [C]home[G]
