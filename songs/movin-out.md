[Verse]
[Dm]Anthony works in the [Gm]grocery store
[C]Saving his pennies for somed[F]ay
[Dm]Mama Leone left a [Gm]note on the door
She said, "[C]Sonny, move out to the co[F]untry"

[Bridge]
[Dm]Working too hard can give you a [G]heart attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack
[A#]You ought to know by [C]now
[Dm]Who needs a house out in [G]Hackensack?
Is [C]that all you get for your [F]money?

[Chorus]
It [A#]seems like a waste of [C]time,    if [A]that's what it's all a[Dm]bout
[Dm]Mama, if [A#]that's movin' up then [Em]I'm  .[A].. movin[[]' [Dm]out[]]

[Verse]
[Dm]Sergeant O'Leary is [Gm]walking the beat
At [C]night he becomes a bar [F]tender
He works at [Dm]Mister Cacciatore's down on [Gm]Sullivan Street
A[C]cross from the Medical Ce[F]nter

[Bridge]
And he's [Dm]trading in his Chevy for a [G]Cadillac-ac-ac-ac-ac-ac
[A#]You ought to know by [C]now
And [Dm]if he can't drive with a [G]broken back
At [C]least he can polish the fe[F]nders

[Chorus]
It [A#]seems like a waste of [C]time,    if [A]that's what it's all a[Dm]bout
[Dm] Yea, if [A#]that's movin' up then [Em]I'm  .[A].. movin[[]' [Dm]out[]]

[Bridge]
[Dm]You should never argue with a [G]crazy ma-ma-ma-ma-ma-mind
[A#]You ought to know by [C]now
You can [Dm]pay Uncle Sam with the [G]overtime
Is [C]that all you get for your m[F]oney?

[Chorus]
And if [A#]that's what you have in [C]mind, yeah, if [A]that's what you're all a[Dm]bout
[Dm] Good [A#]luck movin' up 'cos [Em]I'm  .[A].. movin[[]' [Dm]out[]]
