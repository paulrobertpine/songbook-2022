[Intro]

[D] [Bm]


[Verse 1]

[D]This was all you, none of it me
You put your hands all over my body and told me
You [Bm]told me you were ready
[D]For the big one, for the big jump
I'd be your last love everlasting [Bm]you and me
That was what you told me


[Pre-Chorus]

[D]I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it al[Bm]l
You set me free, oh


[Chorus]

[D]Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've [Bm]gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
[D]Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've [Bm]gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
[D]


[Verse 2]

[D]I was too strong, you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat [Bm]rising (rising)
Baby I'm still rising
[D]I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling [Bm]down (down)
There's only one way down


[Pre-Chorus]

[D]I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it a[Bm]ll
You set me free, oh


[Chorus]

[D]Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've [Bm]gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
[D]Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've [Bm]gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more


[Bridge]

[D]If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
[Bm]If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no mo[D]re
No, we ain't kids no [Bm]more


[Pre-Chorus]

[D]I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it al[Bm]l
You set me free, oh


[Chorus]

[D]Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've [Bm]gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
[D]Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've [Bm]gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more


[Outro]

[D]If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've [Bm]gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
[D]If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've [Bm]gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no mo
