[Verse 1]
[Am7]Rotgut whiskey's gonna [G]ease my m[C]ind
[C]Beach towel rests on the d[G]ryin' [Am7]line
Do I re[Am7]mind you of your daddy in his '[G]88 F[C]ord?
[C]Labrador hangin' out the p[G]assenger [Am7]door
The [Am7]sand from your hair is blowin' [G]in my [C]eyes
[C]Blame it on the beach, grown m[G]en don't [Am7]cry
Do you re[Am7]member that beat down b[G]asement c[C]ouch?
I'd sing you [C]my love songs and you'd t[G]ell me ab[Am7]out
How your [Am7]mama ran off and pa[G]wned her r[C]ing
I re[C]member, I remember [G]everyt[Am7]hing

[Chorus]
[F]  A cold shoulder at cl[C]osing time
You were b[G]egging me to stay 'til the [Am7]sun rose
[F]  Strange words c[C]ome on out
Of a g[G]rown man's mouth when his m[Am7]ind's broke
[F]  Pictures and [C]passin' time
You only s[G]mile like that when you're d[Am7]rinking
[F]  I wish I didn't, b[C]ut I do
Re[G]member every moment on the n[Am7]ights with you

[F] [C][G]

[Verse 2]
You're d[Am7]rinkin' everything to e[G]ase your [C]mind
But [C]when the hell are you [G]gonna ease [Am7]mine?
You're like c[Am7]oncrete feet in the s[G]ummer h[C]eat
It [C]burns like hell when t[G]wo souls [Am7]meet
No, you'll [Am7]never be the man that you [G]always sw[C]ore
But I'll re[C]member you singin' in that '[G]88 F[Am7]ord

[Chorus]
[F]  A cold shoulder at cl[C]osing time
You were b[G]egging me to stay 'til the [Am7]sun rose
[F]  Strange words c[C]ome on out
Of a g[G]rown man's mouth when his m[Am7]ind's broke
[F]  Pictures and [C]passin' time
You only s[G]mile like that when you're d[Am7]rinking
[F]  I wish I didn't, b[C]ut I do
Re[G]member every moment on the n[Am7]ights with you

[Chorus]
[F]  A cold shoulder at cl[C]osing time
You were b[G]egging me to stay 'til the [Am7]sun rose
[F]  Strange words c[C]ome on out
Of a g[G]rown man's mouth when his m[Am7]ind's broke
[F]  Pictures and [C]passin' time
You only s[G]mile like that when you're d[Am7]rinking
[F]  I wish I didn't, b[C]ut I do
Re[G]member every moment on the n[Am7]ights with you

[Interlude]
[F] [C][G]

[Outro]
[Am7]Rotgut whiskey's gonna [G]ease my m[C]ind
[C]Beach towel rests on the d[G]ryin' [Am7]line
Do I re[Am7]mind you of your daddy in my '[G]88 F[C]ord?
[C]Labrador hangin' out the p[G]assenger [Am7]door
