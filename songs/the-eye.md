[F][C]It really breaks my heart[F], [C]to see a dear old friend[F][c]Go [G]down in the [Am]worn out [F]place [C]again
[F][c]Do you know the sound[F], [C]of a closing door?[F][c]Have you [G]heard that [Am]sound some[F]where be[C]fore?[F][c]Do you wonder i[G]f she kno[Am]ws you[F] anymor[C]e?[G]

[F]I wrapped your love around me like a [C]chain
B[F]ut I never was afraid that it would [G]die
[C]You can dance in a [F]hurrica[Am]ne
[Am]But only if you're standing in the [C]eye[F][c]

[F][c]Where did you learn to wal[F]k, [C]where did you learn to ru[F]n?
[C]Awa[G]y from [Am]every[F]thing you [C]love
[F][c]And did you think the bott[F]le, [C]would ever ease your pain[F]?
[C]Did yo[G]u think that lo[Am]ve's a fo[F]olish ga[C]me?[F]
Did you [C]find some[G]one el[Am]se to t[F]ake the b[C]lame?[G]

[F]I wrapped your love around me like a [C]chain
B[F]ut I never was afraid that it would [G]die
[C]You can dance in a [F]hurrica[Am]ne
[Am]But only if you're standing in the [C]eye

[C]You can dance in a [F]hurrica[Am]ne
[Am]But only if you're standing in the [C]eye

[F][c]I am a sturdy sou[F]l, [C]and there ain't no shame[F][c]In [G]lying d[Am]own in the [F]bed you [C]made[F]
Can you [C]fight the u[G]rge to [Am]run for [F]another d[C]ay?[G]
You might make it [Am]furthe[G]r if you learn to [C]stay

[F]I wrapped your love around me like a [C]chain
B[F]ut I never was afraid that it would [G]die
[C]You can dance in a [F]hurrica[Am]ne
[Am]But only if you're standing in the [G]eye[C]

You can dance in a [F]hurrica[Am]ne
[Am]But only if you're standing in the [C]eye
