Intro
[F]Ve[Bb]rse[F][Dm][Bb]
[F]I am a lonely visitor.
I c[Bb]ame too late to cause a stir,
though I c[F]ampaigned all my l[Dm]ife towards that g[Bb]oal.
I hardly slept the n[A7]ight you wept;
[Dm]our secret's safe and [Dm/C]still well kept
[C]where even Richard Nixon has got s[Dm]oul.
[Bb]Even Richard Nixon has got s[C]oul.[Dm][Bb][Dm][G]

Verse
Tra[F]ffic cops are all color blind.
P[Bb]eople steal from their own kind.
Ev[F]ening comes to e[Dm]arly for a st[Bb]roll.
Down neon streets the st[A7]reaker streaks.
[Dm]The speaker speaks, but the t[Dm/C]ruth still leaks,
w[C]here even Richard Nixon has got s[Dm]oul.

Verse
T[F]he podium rocks in the crowded waves.
T[Bb]he speaker talks of the beautiful saves
t[F]hat went down long [Dm]before he played this [Bb]role
for the hotel queens and the m[A7]agazines,
t[Dm]est tube genes and s[Dm/C]lot machines
wh[Bb]ere even Richard Nixon has [C]got it, s[Dm]oul.[Bb][Dm][G]

Verse
H[F]ospitals have made him cry,
b[Bb]ut there's always a free way in his eye,
t[F]hough his beach just got too cr[Dm]owded for his s[Bb]troll.
Roads stretch out like he[A7]althy veins,
[Dm]and wild gift horses s[Dm/C]train the reins,
w[C]here even Richard Nixon has got s[Dm]oul.
[Bb]Even Richard Nixon has got s[C]oul.[Dm][Bb][G][Bb][A7][Dm]

Verse
I[F]am a lonely visitor.
I[Bb]came too late to cause a stir,
t[F]hough I campaigned all my l[Dm]ife towards that g[Bb]oal.
