title: Oh Susanna
artist: Stephen Foster
key: G
---

I [G]come from Alabama with a banjo on my [D]knee,
I’m [G]going to Louisiana, my [D]true love for to [G]see
It [G]rained all night the day I left, the weather it was [D]dry
The [G]sun so hot I froze to death; [D]Susanna, don’t you [G]cry.

Oh, [C]Susanna, [G]don’t you cry for [D]me
cos’ I [G]come from Alabama
With my [D]banjo on my [G]knee.

I [G]had a dream the other night when everything was [D]still,
I [G]thought I saw Susanna [D]coming up the [G]hill,
A [G]buck wheat cake was in her mouth, a tear was in her [D]eye,
I [G]said I’m coming from the south, [D]Susanna don’t you [G]cry.

chorus

I [G]soon will be in New Orleans and then I’ll look a-[D]round
And [G]when I find my Susanna, I’ll [D]fall upon the [G]ground
But [G]if I do not find her, this man will surely [D]die
And [G]when I’m dead and buried, [D]Susanna don’t you [G]cry.
