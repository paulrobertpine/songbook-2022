[D] [G] [A] [G] [D] [G]

[D]In the early morning [A]rain
[G]With a dollar in my [D]hand
With an aching in my [Em]heart
[G]And my pockets full of [D]sand
I'm a long ways from [Em]home
[G]And I missed my loved one [D]so
In the early morning [A]rain
[G]With no place to [D]go

Out on runway number [A]nine
[G]Big 707 set to [D]go
But I?m stuck here in the [Em]grass
[G]Where the cold wind [D]blows
Now the liquor tasted [Em]good
[G]And the women all were [D]fast
Well there she goes my [A]friend
[G]She's rolling down at [D]last[G][A][G][D][G][D]

Hear the mighty engines [A]roar
[G]See the silver bird on [D]high
She's away and westward [Em]bound
[G]Far above the clouds she [D]flies
Where the morning rain don't [Em]fall
[G]And the sun always [D]shines
She'll be flying over my [A]home
[G]In about three hours [D]time[G][A][G][D][G][D]

This old airport?s got me [A]down
[G]It's no earthly good to [D]me
'Cause I?m stuck here on the [Em]ground
[G]As cold and drunk as I can [D]be
You can't jump a jet [Em]plane
[G]Like you can a freight [D]train
So I best be on my [A]way
[G]In the early morning [D]rain

You can't jump a jet [Em]plane
[G]Like you can a freight [D]train
So I best be on my [A]way
[G]In the early morning [D]rain
