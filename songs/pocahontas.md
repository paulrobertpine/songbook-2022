[A] [Asus2][A][Asus][A]

[A]Aurora borealis
[A]The icy sky at night
[Bm]Paddles cut the water
[A]In a long and hurried flight
From the [E]white man[G]
to the [D]fields of [A]green
And the [E]homeland[G]
we've [D]never [A]seen.

[A]They killed us in our teepees
[A]And they cut our women down
[Bm]They might have left some babies
[A]Cryin' on the ground
But the [E]firesticks[G]
and the [D]wagons [A]come
And the [E]night falls[G]
on the [D]setting [A]sun.

[A]They massacred the buffalo
[A]Kitty corner from the bank
[Bm]The taxis run across my feet
[A]And my eyes have turned to blanks
In my [E]little box[G]
at the [D]top of the [A]stairs
With my [E]Indian rug[G]
and a [D]pipe to [A]share.

[A] [Asus2][A][Asus][A][Asus2][A][Asus][A][Bm][A][E][G][D][A]

[A]I wish a was a trapper
[A]I would give thousand pelts
[Bm]To sleep with Pocahontas
[A]And find out how she felt
In the [E]morning[G]
on the [D]fields of [A]green
In the [E]homeland[G]
we've [D]never [A]seen.

[A]And maybe Marlon Brando
[A]Will be there by the fire
[Bm]We'll sit and talk of Hollywood
[A]And the good things there for hire
And the [E]Astrodome[G]
and the [D]first [A]teepee
Marlon [E]Brando,[G]
Poca[D]hontas and [A]me
Marlon [E]Brando,[G]
Poca[D]hontas and [A]me
Poca[E]hontas.[G][D][A]
