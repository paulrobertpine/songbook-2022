[Dm] [A][Bb][F]

[Dm]My whole [A]Saturday and [Bb]Sunday [F]too
[Dm]I was [A]thinkin''bout [Bb]ways not to [F]lose
[Dm]I lay down [A]my weapons [Bb]is what I've [F]done
[Dm]Too late to [A]hide, [Bb]feet too soft to [F]run
But people say I'm the [G7]luckiest man[A7sus4][A7]

And yeah they say

[Bb]Runnin' is [F]useless [Bb]and fightin' is [F]foolish
[Bb]You're not gonna [F]win but still you're the [Bb]luckiest [F]man you're up against
[Bb]And too many [F]horses [Bb]and mysterious [F]forces
[Bb]What you don't [F]know is you are the [Bb]luckiest [F]man
You're the [Bb]luckiest man

[Dm] [A][Bb][F]

[Dm]I done talked to the [A]devil [Bb]when he calls my [F]name
[Dm]But sometimes [A]when I'm losing it [Bb]all seems the [F]same
[Dm]And when I [A]fall I'm [Bb]back up [F]again
[Dm]Just to slip on the [A]same mistakes and [Bb]slide right back [F]in
But people say I'm the [G7]luckiest man[A7sus4][A7]

And yeah they say

[Bb]Running is [F]useless [Bb]and fighting is [F]foolish
[Bb]You're not gonna [F]win but still you're the [Bb]luckiest [F]man you're up against
[Bb]And too many [F]horses [Bb]and mysterious [F]forces

[Dm] [A][Bb][F]

[Dm]Try to keep my [A]faith and [Bb]keep my [F]mind
[Dm]Hate to lose [A]either one when the [Bb]whip cracks [F]behind
[Dm]And I can't [A]help but mourning just a [Bb]little each [F]night
[Dm]People say [A]everything is gonna [Bb]be a[F]lright
But people say I'm the [G7]luckiest man[A7sus4][A7]
