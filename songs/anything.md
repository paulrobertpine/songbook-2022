[Intro]
 
Eb Eb
 
[Verse]
 
Eb
Staring down the barrel of the hot sun
Cm7
Shining with the sheen of a shotgun
Abmaj7
Carol has a little if we need some
Bb
Joy has a ride if we wanna come
 
Eb
Hanging your jeans with a clothes pin
Cm7
Skin still wet, still on my skin
Abmaj7
Mango in your mouth, juice dripping
Bb
Shoulder of your shirtsleeve slipping
 
Eb
Christmas Eve with your mother and sis
Cm7
Don’t wanna fight but your mother insists
Abmaj7
Dog’s white teeth slice right through my fist
Bb
Drive to the ER and they put me on a risk
 
Eb
Grocery store list, now you get pissed
Cm7
Unchecked calls and messages
Abmaj7
I don’t wanna be the owner of your fantasy
Bb
I just wanna be a part of your family
 
[Chorus]
 
Cm7
And I don’t wanna talk about anything
Bb
I don’t wanna talk about anything
Abmaj7
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Abmaj7
Wanna witness your eyes looking
Cm7
I don’t wanna talk about anyone
Bb
I don’t wanna talk about anyone
Abmaj7
I wanna sleep in your car while you’rе driving
                               Eb
Lay in your lap when I’m crying
 
[Verse]
 
Eb
Circle of pine and red oak
Cm7
Circle of moss and fire smoke
Abmaj7
Fan on the ceiling like a wheel spoke
Bb
Push the clutch in and I pull the choke
 
Eb
Wanna listen to the sound of you blinking
Cm7
Wanna listen to your hands soothe
Abmaj7
Listen to your heart beating
Bb
Listen to the way you move
 
[Chorus]
 
Cm7
And I don’t wanna talk about anything
Bb
I don’t wanna talk about anything
Abmaj7
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Abmaj7
Wanna witness your eyes looking
Cm7
I don’t wanna talk about anyone
Bb
I don’t wanna talk about anyone
Abmaj7
I wanna sleep in your car while you’rе driving
                               Eb
Lay in your lap when I’m crying
 
Eb Cm7 Abmaj7 Bb
 
[Verse]
 
Eb
Weren’t we the stars in Heaven
Cm7
Weren’t we the salt in the sea
Abmaj7
Dragon in the new warm mountain
Bb
Didn’t you believe in me?
 
Eb
Yeah, you held me the whole way through
Cm7
When I couldn’t see the words like you
Abmaj7
I was scared, Indigo, but I wanted to
Bb
I was scared, Indigo, but I wanted to
 
[Chorus]
 
Cm7
And I don’t wanna talk about anything
Bb
I don’t wanna talk about anything
Abmaj7
I wanna kiss, kiss your eyes again
Abmaj7
Wanna witness your eyes looking
Cm7
I don’t wanna talk about anyone
Bb
I don’t wanna talk about anyone
Abmaj7
I wanna sleep in your car while you’re driving
                               Eb
Lay in your lap when I’m crying
