[E]Buckets of rain
[E]Buckets of tears
[E]Got all them buckets comin' out of my ears
[A]Buckets of moonbeams in my [E]hand
[B]You got all the [A]love, [G#m]honey baby [F#m]I can [E]stand

[E]I been meek
And [E]hard like an oak
I've [E]seen pretty people disappear like smoke
[A]Friends will arrive, friends will disap[E]pear
If [B]you want [A]me, [G#m]honey baby [F#m]I'll be [E]here

I [E]like your smile
And your [E]fingertips
I [E]like the way that you move your hips
I [A]like the cool way you look at [E]me
[B]Everything a[A]bout you is [G#m]bringing me [F#m]mise[E]ry

[E]Little red wagon
[E]Little red bike
I [E]ain't no monkey but I know what I like
I [A]like the way you love me strong and [E]slow
I'm [B]takin' you [A]with me, [G#m]honey baby [F#m]when I [E]go

[E]Life is sad
[E]Life is a bust
[E]All ya can do is do what you must
You [A]do what you must do and ya do it [E]well
I'll [B]do it for [A]you, [G#m]honey baby, [F#m]can't you [E]tell?
