Capo 2     Same Chords all verses

E                       D          A
I saw a werewolf with a Chinese menu in his hand

E                    D        A
Walking through the streets of Soho in the rain

E                    D               A
He was looking for a place called Lee Ho Faulk's

E                      D                A
Going to get himself a big dish of beef chow mien

E        A           D
Ohwwh  Werewolves of London

E        A           D
Ohw..............www


If you hear him howling around your kitchen door
Better not let him in
Little old lady got mutilated late last night
Werewolves of London again
Ohwww  Werewolves of London 
Ohw ............www  

He's the hairy-handed gent who ran amuck in Kent
Lately he's been overheard in Mayfair
Better stay away from him
He'll rip your lungs out, Jim
Huh I'd like to meet his tailor
Ohwww  Werewolves of London 
Ohw ..........www  


Well, I saw Lon Chaney walking with the Queen
Doing the Werewolf of London
I saw Lon Chaney, Jr. walking with the Queen
Doing the Werewolf of London
I saw a werewolf drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic's
His hair was perfect
Ohwww  Werewolves of London 
Ohw ..........www
