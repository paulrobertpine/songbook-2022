C    E7        Am
Baby mellow my mind,
         D7
Makes me feel,
       G                 C
Like a Schoolboy on good time.
          E7         Am
Jugglin' nickels and dimes
      D7
Satis-fied,
         G
With the fish on the line.

Cmaj7
I've been down the road,
C7
And I've come back,
Fmaj7                   E7
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track.
Am        C/G              F
Ain't got nothin' of those feelings
       D7       G
That I had.
C         E7         Am
Something so hard to find,
D7
Situation,
         G              C
That can casualize your mind.

C    E7    Am   D7    G
C    E7    Am   D7    G

Cmaj7
I've been down the road,
C7
And I've come back,
Fmaj7                   E7
Lonesome whistle on the railroad track.
Am         C/G             F
Ain't got nothin' of those feelings
       D7      G
That I had.

(repeat first verse and end at fish on the line)
