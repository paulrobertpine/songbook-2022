[Dm]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[Dm]Shady Grove I say
[F]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[C]I'm bound to go a[Dm]way

[Dm]Cheeks as red as a [C]blooming rose
[Dm]And eyes are the prettiest brown
[F]She's the darling [C]of my heart
[C]Sweetest little girl in  [Dm]town

[Dm]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[Dm]Shady Grove I say
[F]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[C]I'm bound to go a[Dm]way

[Dm]I wish I had a [C]big fine horse
And [Dm]corn to feed him on
And [F]Shady Grove to [C]stay at home
[C]And feed him while I'm [Dm]gone

[Dm]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[Dm]Shady Grove I say
[F]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[C]I'm bound to go a[Dm]way

[Dm]Went to see my [C]Shady Grove
She was [Dm]standing in the door
Her [F]shoes and stockin's [C]in her hand
[C]And her little bare feet on the [Dm]floor

[Dm]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[Dm]Shady Grove I say
[F]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
I'm bound to go a[Dm]way

[Dm]When I was [C]a little boy
I [Dm]wanted a Barlow knife
And [F]now I want little Shady Grove
To [C]say she'll be my  [Dm]wife

[Dm]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[Dm]Shady Grove I say
[F]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[C]I'm bound to go a[Dm]way

[Dm]Kiss from pretty little [C]Shady Grove
Is [Dm]sweet as brandy wine
And there [F]ain't no girl in [C]this old world
[C]That's prettier than [Dm]mine

[Dm]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[Dm]Shady Grove I say
[F]Shady Grove, [C]my little love
[C]I'm bound to go a[Dm]way

[Additional Verses]

[Dm]Wish I had a [C]glass of wine
And [Dm]bread and meat for two
I'd [F]set it out on a [C]golden plate
[C]And I'd give it all to [Dm]you

[Dm]Peaches in the [C]summertime
[Dm]Apples in the fall
If [F]I can't have little [C]Shady Grove
[C]I don't want no gal at [Dm]all

[Dm]If I had a [C]needle and thread
As [Dm]fine as I can sew
I'd [F]sew my pretty girl [C]to my side
[C]And down the road we [Dm]go
