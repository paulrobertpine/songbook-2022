[C]Kingdoms and [F]queens they all [G]bow down to [C]you,
Branches and [Am]ranch hands a[F]re bowin' [C]too
[C]And Ive taken [Am]off my s[F]traw hat for [G]you, singing
[C]Here comes the [G]sun again[C]

[C]The leaves on the [F]trees they all c[G]all out your [C]name,
Chrome on the [Am]freight line [F]shines the s[C]ame
[C]And the stars in [Am]their cars roll their t[F]arps down for [G]you singing,
[C]Here comes the [G]sun again[C]

Oh but [Em]if you're gunna stay show some [Am]mercy today
[F]Lonely [G]breeze on my [C]face

Snow banks drift down the hillside for you,
slides inside sandy river before the day is through,
and before evenin' falls I may find myself there too, singing
here comes the sun again, here comess the sun again
