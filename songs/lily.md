Capo on 5th
x2
[C] [F][C][F]

[Verse]
[C]Lily is a blinding light [F]devouring the [C]dark
[C]Lily is a 5 alarm [F]fire that rages inside my [C]hear
[C]And all I [F]want to [C]do is tell her [F]that my love is [C]tru
[C]Tell her [F]that my love is [E7]true[F]
[C]Lily is a big brass band [F]who fills the air with [C]song
[C]Lily is a destination [F]and she’s where my arms be[C]long

[Verse]
[C]And whenever [F]she is there with [C]me I know [F]where I’m supposed to [C]be
[C]I know where I want to [E7]be[F][C]
And [Am]I just [E7]flip when I [F]kiss her l[C]ips
And [Am]all my [Dm]senses [G]reel
[C]Lily’s the Pacific Ocean [F]and I’m standing at her [C]shores
[C]And Lily she is never-ending[F]
There’s so much left in [C]store
[C]So all I [F]want to [C]do is tell her t[F]hat my love is [C]true
[C]Tell her [F]that my love is [E7]true[F]
