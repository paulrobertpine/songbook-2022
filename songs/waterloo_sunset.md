Dirty old r[D]iver, must you keep r[A]olling, rolling int[G]o the night
People so b[D]usy make me feel d[A]izzy, taxi lights sh[G]ine so bright
But I d[Em]on't  [B]   need no fr[Em7]iends[A]
As long as I g[D]aze on Waterloo S[A]unset, I am in p[G]aradise[G][B][E]
Every day I lo[E7]ok at the world from my w[A]indow[G][B][E]
Chilly-chilly is the [E7]evening time, [A7]Waterloo sunset's fine.

Terry meets[D] Julie, Waterloo Stat[A]ion, every Friday n[G]ight
But I am so[D] lazy, don't want [A]to wander, I stay at[G]home at night
But I d[Em]on't f[B]eel afraid[Em7][A]
As long as I g[D]aze on Waterloo S[A]unset, I am in p[G]aradise[G][B][E]
Every day I lo[E7]ok at the world from my w[A]indow[G][B][E]
Chilly-chilly is the [E7]evening time, [A7]Waterloo sunset's fine.

Millions of p[D]eople swarming like f[A]lies round Waterloo u[G]nderground
But Terry and J[D]ulie cross over the r[A]iver where they feel s[G]afe and sound
And the[Em]y don'[B]t need no fri[Em7]ends[A]
As long as the[D]y gaze on Waterlo[A]o Sunset, they a[G]re in pa[G]ra[B]di[E]se
Every day I lo[E7]ok at the world from my w[A]indow[G][B][E]
[A7]Waterloo sunset's fine.
