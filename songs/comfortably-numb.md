[Verse 1]
Bsus2  Bm
Hello?
                 A
Is there anybody in there?
                    G      G/F#   Em
Just nod if you can hear me
         Bm
Is there anyone at home?
Bsus2      Bm
Come on now
              A
I hear you're feeling down
G          G/F#    Em
I can ease your pain
            Bm
And get you on your feet again
Bsus2  Bm
Relax
                    A
I'll need some information first
G             G/F# Em
Just the basic facts
        Bm
Can you show me where it hurts?
 
[Chorus]
D                          A
There is no pain you are receding
D                             A
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
G/B C                             G
   You are only coming through in waves
G/B C                                       G
   Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     D                     A
When I was a child I had a fever
   D                           A
My hands felt just like two balloons
G/B C                             G
  Now I've got that feeling once again, I can't explain,
          G/B C                             G
You would not understand, This is not how I am
 
A   G/B  Cadd9         G                D
I               have become comfortably numb.

I         have become comfortably numb.
 
[Verse 2]
Bsus2  Bm
O.K.
              A
Just a little pinprick
                    G    Em
There'll be no more aaaaaaaah!
            Bm
But you may feel a little sick
Bsus2         Bm
Can you stand up?
                  A
I do believe it's working, good
                 G                  Em
That'll keep you going through the show
     Bm
Come on it's time to go.
 
[Chorus]
D                           A
There is no pain, you are receding
D                             A
A distant ship smoke on the horizon
G/B C                              G
    You are only coming through in waves
G/B  C                                      G
    Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
     D                         A
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
D                       A
Out of the corner of my eye
G/B C                           G
    I turned to look but it was gone
                   G/B C
I cannot put my finger on it now
                        G
The child is grown, The dream is gone
 
Asus4   A  G/B  Cadd9    G                D
And  I           have become comfortably numb.
