CAPO: II

[G] [Bm/F#][Em][C]

[G]I heard that you're [Bm/F#]settled down
That you [Em]   found a girl and you're [C]married now
[G]I heard that your [Bm/F#]dreams came true
Guess she [Em]gave you things I didn't [C]give to you
[G]Old friend, why are you [Bm/F#]so shy?
Ain't like [Em]you to hold back or [C]hide from the light

I [D9]hate to turn up out of the [Em]blue uninvited
But I [C]couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd [D9]hoped you'd see my face and [Em]that you'd be reminded
That for [C]me it isn't o - [Em]ver

[G]  Never mind, I'll [D]find someone like [Em]you - [C]ou
I wish [G]nothing but the [D]best for [Em]you [C]two
Don't for[G]get me, I [D]beg, I'll re[Em]member you [C]said
Sometimes it [G]lasts in love but [D]sometimes it hurts in[Em]stea - [C]ead
Sometimes it [G]lasts in love but [D]sometimes it hurts in[Em]stea - [C]ead

[G]  You know how the [Bm/F#]time flies
Only [Em]   yesterday was the [C]time of our lives
We were [G]born and raised in a [Bm/F#]summer haze
Bound [Em]by the surprise of our [C]glory days

I [D9]hate to turn up out of the [Em]blue uninvited
But I [C]couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I'd [D9]hoped you'd see my face and [Em]that you'd be reminded
That for [C]me it isn't [D]o - [Em]ver[D]

[G]  Never mind, I'll [D]find someone like [Em]you - [C]ou
I wish [G]nothing but the [D]best for [Em]you [C]two
Don't for[G]get me, I [D]beg, I'll re[Em]member you [C]said
Sometimes it [G]lasts in love but [D]sometimes it hurts in[Em]stead, [C]yeah

[D]Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Re[Em]grets and mistakes, they are memories made
[C]Who would have known how bitter[Am]sweet [G]this would [C]taste?[D]

[G]  Never mind, I'll [D/F#]find someone like [Em]you - [C]ou
I wish [G]nothing but the [D/F#]best for [Em]you - [C]ou
Don't for[G]get me, I [D]beg, I'll re[Em]member you [C]said
Sometimes it [G]lasts in love but [D/F#]sometimes it hurts in[Em]stea - [C]ead

[G] Never mind, I'll [D]find someone like [Em]you - [C]ou
I wish [G]nothing but the [D/F#]best for [Em]you [C]two
Don't for[G]get me, I [D]beg, I'll re[Em]member you [C]said
Sometimes it [G]lasts in love but [D]sometimes it hurts in[Em]stea - e[C]ad
Sometimes it [G]lasts in love but [D]sometimes it hurts in[Em]stea - [C]ya ya ya
